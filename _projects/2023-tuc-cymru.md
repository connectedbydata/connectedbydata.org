Wales has been central to the UK labour movement, and now unions in Wales and TUC Cymru are grappling with how to shape AI. Connected by Data has been working in partnership with TUC Cymru on a series of initiatives, ranging from [research on how workers in Wales are experiencing and engaging with AI](/resources/wales-tuc-experiencing-ai) and [developing training materials](/events/2024-07-09-wales-tuc-training). Connected by Data has also been advising TUC Cymru as part of an AI reference group for trade union members of the Workforce Partnership Group, part of the Welsh government’s social partnership approach to working with unions.

Building on this, we’re delivering a project with TUC Cymru on how worker voice can be embedded into emerging processes and policy on [procurement of data and AI systems in the public sector in Wales](/events/2024-10-15-design-lab-procurement).
