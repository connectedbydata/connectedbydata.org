Connected conversations are a programme of informal, virtual discussion sessions designed to support exploration and learning around the fundamentals of collective, democratic, participatory and deliberative data governance.

<!--more-->

The goals of the programme are to:
* build a body of understanding, knowledge and evidence on topics relevant to the vision and mission of **CONNECTED** BY **DATA**
* amplify innovative work across the field
* create connections between those interested in the area
* build our internal capacity on these topics

The focus for Connected conversations are unanswered questions, difficult issues, and complex topics. People who attend discussions are expected to have strong opinions, weakly held, and to critique and question their own assumptions, as well as those of other people.

Below are the writeups of previously held Connected Conversations and links to forthcoming ones.

If you would like to propose a topic for a Connected Conversation please [contact Helena](mailto:helena@connectedbydata.org).
