Communities are affected daily in both positive and negative ways by data governance decisions made by local and national governments. These arise through interactions with public services such as health and care; schooling; policing and justice; tax and benefits, as well as in more pervasive ways through government’s collection and dissemination of data, statistics and evidence to inform policymaking.

Over the past year (2024-25) we have been working to develop good practices and policies around public and community engagement with data and AI projects in the public sector. This work has been well-received, including partnerships with DSIT’s National Data Library team, the Office for Statistics Regulation, and TUC Cymru / the Welsh Government, and the development of a public-sector-wide community of practice on public participation.

The change of Government increases the opportunities for this work. The new Government is more open to working with civil society, and to participatory approaches. However, the public sector needs reskilling in how to meaningfully involve affected communities in decision-making. Developing robust norms, policies, guidance and experience of public engagement, particularly around data, digital, and AI, are necessary to ensure that the new Government’s pro-technology political stance translates into public and public sector adoption, and public good.

### Our approach

We are grateful to [The Mohn Westlake Foundation](https://www.themohnwestlakefoundation.co.uk/) for granting us further funding to continue this work and specifically to:
* Continue supporting the **dissemination, piloting and revision of guidance** developed during the first year of this work, on public participation in the procurement of data and AI systems, the development of official statistics, and the sharing of data through the National Data Library.
* Run another **two Design Labs**, one in partnership with DSIT as the “digital centre” for government, to strengthen public engagement around the next stage of the digital transformation of the public sector, and one with a department such as DfE, DHSC, MoJ or MHCLG, to develop public engagement around AI tools being adopted in their sectors (education, health, justice or local communities).
* Continue and expand the **Community of Practice** for public participation practitioners in the public sector, including monthly meetings and another unconference to help them learn from each other and external experts.
* Support our **ad-hoc engagement** with policymakers and practitioners on the topic of public and worker engagement around data and AI systems in the public sector, including through events, meetings, advisory boards, consultation responses, case studies, blogs and commentary.

If we are successful, we will have embedded new participatory practices within dozens of public sector bodies, as the guidance we co-create is adopted by data and AI commissioners, statistics producers, digital service designers, and organisations sharing data through the National Data Library. We will also have developed a self-organising, engaged community of practitioners within the public sector who are able to engage with the public in meaningful ways.

Longer term, we will have increased the degree to which the public is engaged in the development and deployment of data and AI systems by the public sector. Through that, we will have reduced the degree to which these systems harm people, groups and communities, increased and improved the use of data to deliver public benefits, and built greater public trust and confidence in the use of data and AI across government.
