We are working with [DfE](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) to develop a creative engagement toolkit to support participatory sessions with children and young people (ages 10–18) in schools, colleges, youth groups, and community settings. The toolkit will help facilitators gather youth perspectives on generative AI in education, with a focus on what they want technology companies to consider.
