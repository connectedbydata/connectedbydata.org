We are working with [DfE](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) to develop a creative engagement toolkit to support participatory sessions with children and young people (ages 10â€“18) in schools, colleges, youth groups, and community settings. The toolkit will help facilitators gather youth perspectives on generative AI in education, with a focus on what they want technology companies to consider.
