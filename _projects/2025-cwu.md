We’re collaborating with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) to develop the practical skills needed to identify and negotiate the impact of AI on workers in the telecoms, tech and financial services sectors. 

Through a series of action-oriented workshops over 5 months, union reps and officers will dig into the concepts and tools of building worker power on data and AI and apply learning in workplaces. We will work towards collective agreements, lasting partnerships between CWU, civil society, and academic allies and the bolstering of the union’s political advocacy on technology.
