The [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)’s [Digital Governance challenge](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/the-open-gov-challenge/open-government-challenge-areas/#toc05) calls for national and local governments to commit to “strengthen transparency and public oversight of AI, automated-decision making, and data protection frameworks” including by “creating specific public participation opportunities”. 

To support this, we’ve been commissioned to carry out a mapping of organisations that are developing and leading participatory digital governance activities, and to identify possible examples of participatory digital governance that might inspire new commitments and actions.
