**CONNECTED** BY **DATA** were commissioned by [Public Voices in AI](https://digitalgood.net/dg-research/public-voices-in-ai/) to facilitate a People’s Advisory Panel supporting their year long project, following our success with the [People's Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai).

<!--more-->
The Responsible AI UK programme on Public Voices in AI, coordinated by the Digital Good Network, was a year long programme (April 2024 - March 2025) working to “ensure that public voices are front and centre in artificial intelligence research, development and policy.”.
The project involved a number of tracks, including:
* Evidence review;
* Survey research;
* Resource production;
* Synthesis products

The PVAI People’s Advisory Panel has been made up of six members of the public from across the United Kingdom, recruited on the basis of varied past experience of public engagement on AI. It was created to provide advisory input to the Public Voices in AI research programme, offering input to work-package leads through regular facilitated Zoom meetings. 

The six members of the panel: Margaret, Sharif, Samer, Farheen, Cameron and Adam drew on their lived experience in different communities across the UK to help PVAI reflect on the who, why and how of public involvement, and how PVAI research and research outputs might be received in different settings.
