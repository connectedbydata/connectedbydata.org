The official push to roll out AI in education (among every other area…) throws up sticky questions of pedagogy, practicality and professionalism. Yet too often the voices of educators – support staff, teachers, school leaders and specialists – are squeezed out by the promises of Edtech products offering to solve everything from attainment to attendance.

These millions of educators retain deep embodied knowledge and experience of the realities of education and their students, not decontextualised data, models or predictions. They are professionals whose skill and commitment must be empowered by technology and never undermined. Educators are the group most trusted by parents to make decisions about the use of AI in education – well above Edtech companies and the government. This trust is essential to support the diffusion of what is, for many, a contentious technology. These educators and their unions must be heard, by critics, boosters, policy makers and Edtech developers. 

In partnership with the [TUC](https://www.tuc.org.uk/), and supported by the [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/), we’re working with nine unions representing millions of workers in the education sector, across every job group in Wales, Scotland and England.*

## Action learning for educators to understand, negotiate and advocate on AI
In a 7-month action-learning project starting in September 2025, officers from participating unions engage in monthly sessions to explore concepts and topics central to the adoption of AI in education, and take action to strengthen educator voice.  

Guests from academia, civil society, the private sector and unions abroad have been engaged as the group builds capacity to understand and respond to issues ranging from pedagogy and learning; democratising AI governance including through collective bargaining; and enhancing the professional autonomy and skills of educators working with AI and Edtech. 

## What’s next? 
The project with education workers is part of a wider project with the TUC around AI and digital technologies. A key priority is enabling the unique role of trade unions – in collaboration with civil society – to act as the necessary countervailing force to the powerful and often narrow interests and perspectives that drive the AI industry. Lessons from this initial 7-month education-focused action-learning project will feed into this wider work extending to workers and unions across sectors.
