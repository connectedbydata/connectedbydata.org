As part of our project on[ ‘Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects’](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake), we’re interested in supporting practitioners – particularly in the public sector – who are engaging the public on data and AI. To that end, we convene up a community of practice.

We’re keen that it complements and brings together existing networks (such as PADAI, PEDRI and the cross-government participatory methods forum). We hold an online meeting every month; bringing together interested parties from central, devolved and local government, the wider public sector, and civil society, academia and the private sector; allowing people to share their work and also providing a space to work through common challenges.

The network is meeting on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an [existing data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

Past and future meetings of the Community of Practice can be seen below.
