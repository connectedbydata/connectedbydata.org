We believe effective data governance should be: collective, democratic, participatory, deliberative and powerful. 

But what should organisations collecting, using or stewarding data, and the communities that data affects, do in order to achieve this? And how can we show that the often dry topic of data governance is something that demands creative and critical engagement? 

We've been running a multi-stage design lab to explore the creation of a serious game (or games) that can help individuals and organisations to think about planning, running and evaluating collective and participatory data governance activities. 

You can [find the working draft of the game here](/game).

Over the coming months we're looking for opportunities to iterate on this resource further, and developing resources to support its use in organisational and workshop settings.
