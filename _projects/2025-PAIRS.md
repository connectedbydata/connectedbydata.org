We co-organised the first [Participatory AI Research and Practice Symposium](https://www.pairs.site) at the AI Action Summit in Paris in 2025 as a space to bring together researcher, practitioners, policy makers, activists and industry to share learning on embedding participatory approaches to AI development, governance and resistance. 

Over the coming year we will be dedicating time to the next edition of PAIRS, and to developing PAIRSx events that look at participatory AI in different thematic communities.
