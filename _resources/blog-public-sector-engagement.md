Whenever we speak to public servants who are keen to involve the public more on decisions about data and AI, an early subject to be raised is always: who’s already done it, and how did they do it? People are understandably keen to learn from what has already been tried.

_This blog/case study is part of a series exploring how public sector organisations involve the public, workers and civil society in decisions about data and AI, and some of the consequences when they do not. Read more about [our work on public involvement in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/topics/public-sector)._

In this blogpost, we try to pull together a range of different examples that we’ve found and keep referring back to. It complements our post looking at[ public involvement in statistics](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/public-stats-examples), and the rest of[ our work on public involvement in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/topics/public-sector). We’ve no doubt missed lots of things – please [get in touch](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com) if you’ve got anything to add.
