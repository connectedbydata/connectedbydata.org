How do you run a campaign with change goals focussed on data? 

The Community Campaigns on Data toolkit provides step-by-step guidance to designing community-led campaigns that seek to transform:

* **Data Access** - campaigning to secure access to key datasets, either once-off, or as an ongoing source of open data or digital public infrastructure.

* **Data Definitions** - campoigning to influence the categories used to model data. These questions of dataset design determine who and what is made visible through data, and what is left out, and rendered invisible.

* **Data protection** - campaignign to support individuals and communities to exercise their rights to better understand and control how data about them is collected, used and shared

* **Data governance** campaigning for a role for affected communities in ongoing decision-making over how data is collected, used, interpreted or shared.

* **Counterdata** - campaigning to challenge official or dominant narratives around an issue by collecting and analysing alternative, often community-collected, datasets.

Based on learning from the [Community Campaigns on Data cohort](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities), you can find the toolkit as a [PDF download](/assets/resources/Community_Campaigns_on_Data_Toolkit.pdf), or [online document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit?tab=t.0).
