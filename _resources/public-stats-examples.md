One of the subjects we’ve been looking at as part of our project on [giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) is statistics. In February, we ran a Design Lab with the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) on the role of public participation in statistics, as they refresh the Code of Practice for Statistics.

_This blog/case study is part of a series exploring how public sector organisations involve the public, workers and civil society in decisions about data and AI, and some of the consequences when they do not. Read more about [our work on public involvement in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/topics/public-sector)._

We were going to write up a case study of where the public has been involved in official statistics, as with some of the other subjects we’ve explored, [like](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-legal-aid-agency) [procurement](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-procurement-camden) and the [National Data Library](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-12-05-design-lab-ndl). Indeed, the NDL case study - on the [Confidentiality Advisory Group](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-cag) - may provide a useful model (for example, stats producers wanting their numbers to be marked as ‘official statistics’ could be required to engage the public, in the same way CAG expects engagement before data is made available for research).

But instead, we thought we’d give an overview of some of the examples we’ve found. What have we missed? What should we add? Were you involved in, or do you have any further information about, any of the examples below? Get in touch! 

## **UK Statistics Assembly**
This was recommended by [the Lievesley Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-uk-statistics-authority-uksa-2023) into the UK Statistics Authority in March 2024. (The UKSA is the non-ministerial department which oversees [the UK’s statistical system](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/) - the Office for National Statistics, or ONS, is its executive arm, and the Office for Statistics Regulation its regulatory one.)

The Review said that the Assembly should be triennial and ‘involve key organisations inside and outside Government and across the four nations, with the remit of determining the UK’s needs for statistics through a wide consultative process’. The UKSA should then publish a statement of priorities for the next three years. [The UKSA agreed](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/authority-response-to-the-independent-review-of-the-uk-statistics-authority/), and the Assembly took place in January 2025.

I was lucky enough to go along. [The Assembly](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/uk-statistics-assembly-2025/) was an impressive feat, bringing together hundreds of people in person and online for discussions on subjects including user engagement, AI and statistics, net zero, and the future of the Census. It was a conference, rather than a deliberative assembly, but gave people from the public sector, private sector, third sector and elsewhere the chance to share their views on statistics in the UK. The UKSA has published [a report on the Assembly](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/independent-report-on-the-2025-uk-statistics-assembly/) - one of the [common issues](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/independent-report-on-the-2025-uk-statistics-assembly/pages/4/) that came up across the day was the need to ‘Improve user and public engagement and communication’.
