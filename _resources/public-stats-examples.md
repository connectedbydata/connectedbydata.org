One of the subjects we’ve been looking at as part of our project on [giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) is statistics. In February, we ran a Design Lab with the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) on the role of public participation in statistics, as they refresh the Code of Practice for Statistics.

_This blog/case study is part of a series exploring how public sector organisations involve the public, workers and civil society in decisions about data and AI, and some of the consequences when they do not. Read more about [our work on public involvement in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/topics/public-sector)._

We were going to write up a case study of where the public has been involved in official statistics, as with some of the other subjects we’ve explored, [like](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-legal-aid-agency) [procurement](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-procurement-camden) and the [National Data Library](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-12-05-design-lab-ndl). Indeed, the NDL case study - on the [Confidentiality Advisory Group](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-cag) - may provide a useful model (for example, stats producers wanting their numbers to be marked as ‘official statistics’ could be required to engage the public, in the same way CAG expects engagement before data is made available for research).

But instead, we thought we’d give an overview of some of the examples we’ve found. What have we missed? What should we add? Were you involved in, or do you have any further information about, any of the examples below? Get in touch!
