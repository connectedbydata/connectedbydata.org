This preliminary mapping study, carried out for the Open Government Partnership, seeks to identify the organisations and institutions leading work and thinking on participatory digital governance, and to identify examples of promising practice that might be used in case studies, communications or peer-learning, with a view to informing future SMART recommendations for reforms that could be explored by Open Government Partnership stakeholders.
