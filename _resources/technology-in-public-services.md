The government should make good use of new technologies to deliver better public services with better outcomes for the public, as well as economic growth. Navigating the best course towards that future depends on us avoiding hype and overblown promises, and getting to grips with the real challenges of tech adoption in the public sector. Partnering with the public and civil society is essential for the effective delivery of technology for public services.

This briefing was circulated to relevant MPs prior to the Commons General Debate on Technology in Public Services, held on 2nd September 2024.
