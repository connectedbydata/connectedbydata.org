Building on our extensive work with trade unions, over the first half of 2025 Connected by Data partnered with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) to strengthen worker power on AI.

For the CWU the stakes have risen with key companies like BT announcing an aggressive strategy to cut jobs through AI automation. With a range of technologies applied in different contexts, the CWU needed to build a comprehensive strategy. This required more than one-off events or generic training; it called for capacity building that would establish the infrastructure and momentum for long-term change.

This short summary outlines what we did, what we learnt and what will happen next.
