How can affected communities have a powerful voice in shaping the adoption of data-driven technology in schools?

We brought together 17 participants for [two online workshop sessions in January 2024](/events/2024-01-10-education-design-lab) to explore:

  * the growing use of data-driven educational technologies (EdTech) in UK schools;
  * challenges around who has, and who does not, have a say in EdTech adoption;
  * possible approaches to give affected communities a more powerful voice in EdTech decision making.

Participants included teachers and school counselors, teaching union representatives, and education researchers. Sessions were designed with support from [Defend Digital Me](https://defenddigitalme.org/).

This is an initial synthesis of workshop discussions shared to support further conversations.
