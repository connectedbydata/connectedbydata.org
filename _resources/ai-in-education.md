The 'Generative AI in Education: Have your Say' Workshop in a Box provides adaptable resources for holding discussions with students aged 10 - 18 on benefits and problems of AI in education, supporting deliberation on the issues it raises, and suggesting a range of ways to express feedback. 

Between November 3rd and December 15th 2025 a feedback platform is available to submit the outcomes of workshop sessions as an input to the DfE AI in Education Summit taking place in early 2026.
