At the conclusion of our [Luminate](https://www.luminategroup.com/) funded project, [Catalysing Community Data Campaigns](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities), we submitted a final report with a review of the funded activities (community campaigns cohort, toolkit, influencing and coalition building), what we've achieved, financials and reach statements, and a reflection of lessons learned and what's next. The report finishes with a list of related publications. We open this report here to share our learning.
