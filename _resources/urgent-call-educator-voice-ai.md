_A joint statement made by 10 unions representing education workers, produced as part of the Connected by Data and TUC project '[Building educator’s power to shape AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2025-education-unions)'_

We are ten unions representing millions of educators across the UK – teachers, specialists, support staff, school leaders, and workers throughout the education system. Every day we support, teach and lead in schools, colleges, and universities across all jurisdictions of the UK.

As AI is being rolled out rapidly in education, there is an urgent need to ensure this is shaped by the expertise and professional judgement of these educators. We recognise that AI and education technology (EdTech) can complement human-centred education. But we know that AI cannot solve the education system’s deeper problems: underfunding, teacher shortages, overwhelming workloads, or the social and economic pressures educators face every day. And without clear guardrails, these technologies risk making existing problems worse and undermining both quality of education and students’ best interests. 

To realise the potential that AI in education can offer, educators and their unions must be central to every stage of AI adoption, from policy formation and design, through procurement and deployment, to evaluation. All actors and institutions must ensure that AI and EdTech strengthens, not replaces or undermines, the vital relationships between all education workers and students. 

We set out here the ways in which educator voice must be empowered from end to end, from the highest levels of regulation to decisions at local levels.
