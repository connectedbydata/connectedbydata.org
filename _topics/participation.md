**How can the use of data and AI be aligned with public interest, and reflect the needs of different communities?** Public participation involves creating routes to engage, consult and share power with those affected by data and AI decisions. 

We've been exploring how different public participation practices can bring more voices to the table, and lead to real change in how organisations do data. Through case study research, project evaluation, design labs and hands-on practice we've been looking at participatory data governance from the grassroots to the global.
