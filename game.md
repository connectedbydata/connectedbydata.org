> An engaging exploration of data and AI innovation.

**Data and AI are changing our world. But who gets to decide how?** 

In **The Good Governance Game** you work as a team to plan out the engagement strategy for a digital project. Can you find a mix of methods that give voice to the right people, at the right time? 

> **Beta Testing** We've been developing the good governance game over the last year in partnership with Dissent Games and a small group of collaborators. We've not printed up 50 copies, and we're beta-testing the game in printed and online form. Can you help us? Drop a line to [tim@connectedbydata.org](mailto:tim@connectedbydata.org) if you could run a play-test.

## The deck of cards (beta)

Working with [Dissent Games](https://dissentgames.com/) we've produced cards for The Good Governance Game using Component Studio. We're planning to create an online playable version of the game, but for now you can explore the cards in two formats:

* [PDF: Two pages per-card (fronts and backs)](/assets/resources/2024-06-04-GoodGovGame-Full-Card-Deck-Beta.pdf)

* [PDF: Print and play](/assets/resources/2024-06-04-GoodGovGame-PnP-Cards-Beta.pdf) for double-sided printing on A4 paper to cut out for a playable game

## Scenarios 

The game box contains two example scenarios to play. We're creating more scenarios in the coming months. Interested in a scenario for your project or organisation? [Get in touch](mailto:tim@connectedbydata.org)
