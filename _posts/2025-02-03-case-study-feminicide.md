_As part of our work on the [Community Campaigns on Data: Campaigners Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jgmduqp1336) we have identified a series of case studies that provide an insight into how data is a key component of campaigns._

Violence against women, including lethal violence (feminicide), is a global scourge, frequently under-counted and not reflected in official statistics, leading to inadequate policy response. The [Data Against Feminicide](https://dusp.mit.edu/projects/data-against-feminicide) project has documented the work of numerous individuals and groups across the globe who have sought to confront this ‘missing data’ challenge through [creating counterdata](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/cf-chap2/release/3?readingCollection=16608c58). This involves monitoring media reports, collating geolocated datasets, creating data visualisations and reports, and advocating for changes in state data collection practices. 

[D’Ignazio et. al.](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(22)00127-1?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666389922001271?showall%3Dtrue) emphasis how _“activists enact alternative epistemological approaches to data science that center care, memory, and justice”_, and note the need to recognise the emotional burden placed on volunteer activists who deal with collection of traumatic data. 

For some activists, ‘visibilising’ feminicide is their main focus, whereas for others, counterdata practices are part of wider campaign strategies and activities that involve direct work with those affected. 

**Campaign type:** Counterdata

**Ultimate goals:** Eliminate Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Improve state collected data on GBV.

**Communities involved:** Grassroots activists; local, national and international feminist groups.

**Organisation:** Various.

**Methods used:** Media monitoring; collaborative datasets; data visualisation.
