### What I’ve been doing

Having been interested in the cyber attack on the British Library (still experiencing impacts) and more lately M&S I was doing some extra thinking around risk. I then saw a timely reminder from a freelance communications manager I respect who basically said - if it can happen to large national businesses, it can happen to you. I think it’s easy to think that cyber attackers wouldn’t care about the smaller scale organisations that I am involved with (including Connected by Data) but it also seems true that organisations aren’t targeted by humans, there are just computers searching everywhere to find something they can exploit. Which absolutely means smaller organisations are at risk too (just they may not make the national news). I know from my Trustee work with Consortium that they experience very frequent probes of their website for example. Following that thinking I came across this National Cyber Security Centre [free basic check](https://basiccheck.service.ncsc.gov.uk/) (and it is really easy to use too). And a function that helps you identify a [starter action plan](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberaware/actionplan) to protect yourself (as an individual or organisation) too. 

Last week I gave myself some quality focus time to delve properly into the [Charity Excellence Framework](https://www.charityexcellence.co.uk/) resources. There was loads of information (although personally I’d exercise caution before engaging with their heavily Microsoft provided AI stuff) and I (after initial triage) added 44 potential opportunities to the start of our fundraising pipeline. Also a shout out to CEF’s crowdsourcing type of approach. I noted a link wasn’t working, reported it, and you get a shout out on the updated page.

We’ve also finished, and [published our Annual Report for 2024-25](https://connectedbydata.org/annual-report/2024/) including a summary of our end of year accounts which the Board signed off last week.

We’ve been making progress on other projects including gearing up for a sizeable new one that we hope to get confirmation on in the coming month around workers voices. 

I attended a [Pride in Leadership webinar](https://prideinleadership.co.uk/news-list/how-to-write-a-trans-inclusive-policy-for-your-organisation/)(recording available on their website) on writing trans inclusive polices and the [first of a series](https://digitalgood.net/pvai-seminar-series/) of Public Voices in AI webinars - this one included [Tim, Anna and Margaret talking about the People’s Advisory Panel](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-06-05-pvai-webinar) that we convened.

### What I need to take care of
There's an Engagement Lab about [Embedding public voice in the local governance of data and AI innovation](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-06-24-engagement-lab) that we're hosting in partnership with [The Data Justice Lab at the University of Cardiff](https://datajusticelab.org/) and the [Liverpool City Region Civic Data Co-operative](https://civicdatacooperative.com/). It's in Cardiff at the end of the month and I'm helping be hands on deck so I need to be sure we're ready for that.

We’ve got one confirmed Design Lab in early July (with the Government Digital Service) and are soon to be confirming another, later in the month, with the DfE. Invites/logistics etc need to be sorted.

I’ve got to go through the list of potential new funding opportunities and do the initial triage. I’ve got two others that have passed initial triage and that I’ve allocated to myself to write as they’re relatively small pots and for core costs.

My working hours are going to be changing next week (more on that in my next notes) so I need to be mapping that into my calendar and working out a new ebb and flow for my repeat tasks. 

Outside of work I’ve been successful in securing a new Trustee position for a small charity that I’m very passionate about which is exciting. I’ve got reading to do, to get up to speed on their priorities. I’ll share more on that when my position is confirmed following the next Board meeting.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
I did a [really tough run last weekend](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyjmacaulay.bsky.social/post/3lr4pn5nhjs2o). It was training for an even tougher event coming up for me later this year but I was motivated by a sign they had put up (on a particularly steep and stony hill). I enjoyed the balance of comedy against a more traditional motivational slogan. (Though to be fair I never thought a run around Cheddar Gorge was going to be easy!)

### What I’ve been reading
Not a lot. I’ve fallen back into the doomscrolling night time loop (and there’s a lot of doom to scroll).
