### What I’ve been doing
It’s been about ten working days since my last weeknotes and that period started with my work from home situation being distracted by someone climbing around on my roof cleaning the gutters (not a euphemism and much needed but also quite a distraction). The rest of last week was largely internal meetings and checking in on project progress - good progress is the overall status.

Wednesday was a [community of practice session](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-06-18-community-of-practice) so I was notetaking and found the inputs very interesting (on the theme of using tech as a tool for public participation and in particular deliberation).

Around that we’ve been finalising the agenda and planning for our forthcoming design lab on [involving people in the design of digital public services](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-07-07-design-lab-gds) (that we’re running in a couple of weeks with the GDS) and pinning down some early planning for the design lab after that with the Department for Education.

I’ve just got home from a day and a half in Cardiff, working in person with Tim, supporting the delivery of an engagement lab for local authorities and public participation practitioners to consider ‘[Embedding public voice in the local governance of data and AI innovation](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-06-24-engagement-lab)’. It was great to see generous sharing and lots of people talked about how much it had made them think - and want to take action! (It was also great that they provided welsh cakes with the tea/coffee - yum!)


### What I need to take care of
We’re in the final stages of signing a contract with an organisation to do some work around housing data so I need to finalise getting the deliverables articulated and a mutually acceptable agreement sorted.

There’s some wrapping up bits to do after the Cardiff event and sharing of the community practice notes once my draft has been reviewed by the speakers.

Jeni (who is leading the digital service design event) has given me some preparatory work to do so next week I’ll be clearing a table to draw on big paper.

It feels a bit busy at the moment with reactive and proactive actions around the three big events we’re having in the space of five weeks - and I’m staying hyper alert to ensuring I don’t end up ordering lunch to the wrong venue or travel on the wrong date. 

We’re planning an in person team meeting ahead at the end of July and so that’s some lunch, venue and agenda sorting to do. I’d really love to get one of the fundraising bids done that is sitting on my TODO and it’ll be monthly reconciliation next week too.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
Outside of Connected by Data…I have some news. I am the new Operations Manager for [WRKWLL](https://wrkwll.org/). WRKWLL is “*a diversely talented team united by a desire to drive positive change*”, using their “*skills to support and challenge individuals and organisations to be the best they can be*”. I’m doing one a week for them and three days per week for Connected by Data - but working for both across a four day week. It is the first operations post WRKWLL has had and the opportunity has been created at a point they hope to grow and need to hand off some tasks and functions away from the Partners, and are seeking to improve efficiency and process and structure. I’m excited to be a part of what they’re doing and to add value to that. Working only one a day when there’s so much to do is an interesting boundary that I’m working hard to respect. Huge kudos to Jeni for being so open to her team working flexibly (and meaning it). Again, I feel lucky to be a part of the Connected by Data team.

Also today is my little sister's 40th birthday...how did that happen?!

I haven’t. Rubbish but true.
