I'm supporting [a new open letter on Prioritising AI Literacy for All People](https://weandai.org/updated-open-letter-to-the-uk-government-prioritising-ai-literacy-for-all-people/).

<!--more-->

Last year, just after government announced plans to fund a national AI skills programme, we coordinated [an Open Letter to the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology on the need for an inclusive and critical approach to AI skills and literacy](https://connectedbydata.org/blog/2025/09/18/ai-literacy-letter-reply). On behalf of an informal coalition of critical AI literacy experts, we asked to meet with DSIT, and, eventually, had a reply from DSIT offering to arrange a meeting. But, reshuffles intervened, and despite us chasing up, no meeting was arranged. 

Which is why it was even more dismaying to how far [the launch of the AI Skills Hub](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/free-ai-training-for-all-as-government-and-industry-programme-expands-to-provide-10-million-workers-with-key-ai-skills-by-2030) in late January missed the mark of what is needed. 

Critical data and AI literacy is a foundation for public participation. But delivering this at scale requires the government to listen to and engage with researchers and practitioners who have been developing AI literacy at the front lines.

A number of the co-authors and signatories of last years' letter have come together to produce an update - [open now for signatures](https://weandai.org/revised-open-letter-form) - as well as to put the case for critical AI literacy in the media.
