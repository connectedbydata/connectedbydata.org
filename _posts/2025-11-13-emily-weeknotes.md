### What I’ve been doing
The busy-ness of the last couple of weeks has mainly been around the DfE work that we ([well Tim really](https://bsky.app/profile/connectedbydata.org/post/3m5emejdukj2f)) is doing. I’ve helped with a bid of admin and been learning/playing with the Zoom webinar platform ahead of us running a walkthrough of the toolkit Tim has developed.

We’ve also agreed on our March Conference venue and I’m booking that as well as Jeni having progressed the agenda. It's exciting to see content plans coming together. We’ve got various team members on leave over the next few weeks so we’ve been having good check in sessions on our project progress.

### What I need to take care of
Looks like there’s a lot of PAIRS related work next week including having some time with Tim thinking about the supporting infrastructure for the ongoing efforts, a Stewards Strategy session and hopefully hearing more on an ‘almost over the line’ funder.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
This '[Queer AI for the Ally](https://digitalgood.net/dg-research/queer-ai-for-the-ally/)' is interesting and - if it works - important. (And would hopefully be replicated for other communities if possible).[ ](https://digitalgood.net/dg-research/queer-ai-for-the-ally/)

### What I’ve been reading
Or more specifically watching with this example. Channel 4 Dispatches recently did a programme called “[Will AI Take My Job?](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/will-ai-take-my-job-dispatches)” (spoiler, probably not but it may change it). I mainly watched this as our Adam appears (in his TUC role) but found the whole programme to be engaging and interesting. Various humans are pitted against AI to do the same task and see how well they perform. Worth a watch in my humble opinion.

I also found it useful to [read this NHS weeknotes](https://frankieroberto.github.io/nhsnotes/posts/week-70-ideas-summit/) with tips and reflections on holding a Summit. We’re planning our first conference in March 2026 and whilst there’ll be many differences to this NHS event it’s always useful to have things brought to mind that may otherwise be out of your line of sight. (I believe this in all things).
