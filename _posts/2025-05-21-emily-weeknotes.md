### What I’ve been doing
I’ve been reading ‘[Sensing an Ending](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14hsQgSqdootJgpkzcQkDCvsHv9QJiIAlCD2vG7cvw58/edit)’ produced by Stewarding Loss who help organisations think about a good ending. As Connected by Data was only ever conceived to be a maximum five year campaign we’re starting our thinking about what a good ending looks like for us so I’m doing some reading around that. The balance is caring for our people and our field, continuing to have impact right up until the end, celebrating what we’ve achieved and ensuring there is a useful legacy. I’ve found [this case study from ‘Year Here’ ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vmWD_b2kmUoZZiG_xl9YEHMxyGW5cS6B4w5EUgtLqas/edit?usp=sharing)interesting. 

It’s been a quiet week in the team as Jeni has been in New York with Creative Commons so we haven’t had our usual organisational meetings. I’ve cleared most my actions and tried to get ahead of the curve on some upcoming event planning. 

Outside of work I had an “interview” for a new Trustee position. It’s a charity I feel very passionate about so although I wasn’t looking for another position I couldn’t miss the opportunity to put my hat in the ring. I’ll hopefully hear about that soon. 

### What I need to take care of
As part of the end of year accounting process we’ve got a payroll/pension related issue to sort out. I’ve done a lot of reaching out and reading and cross referencing advice to ensure I understand how to resolve it. I now need to take action on that (just waiting for some revised end of year accounts to be issued).

We’re in insurance renewal season so there’s a bit of back and forth on that to complete. 

Outside of Connected by Data I’ve got an interview on Friday for a freelance operations gig supporting an excellent organisation. It’d be an excellent fit around my Connected by Data workload so I’m prepping and keeping my fingers crossed.

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
Ten years ago[ I wrote a blog](https://emilyjmacaulay.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/oh-when-the-spurs-go-marching-in/) about what being a Tottenham Hotspur supporter meant to me. I feel the same now (except when I attend a home match I’m now one of around 60,000 people in the stadium).

Today I am feeling a deep and intense sense of excitement and nervousness about tonight when we (Tottenham) are playing in the Europa League cup final in Spain (and we haven’t won anything since that blog). I am looking forward to being part of around 150 Somerset Spurs supporters going to the same pub in Taunton to watch the match. We will arrive with hope, with one shared goal and desire. I will weep as the team enters the pitch (and if we score!). How we leave depends on what happens in Spain…

Come On You Spurs!

### What I’ve been reading
I’ve already mentioned the ‘Sensing the End’ reading I’ve been doing. I haven’t been reading for pleasure at all recently but hoping to do some of that over a sunny Bank Holiday weekend.

I did [come across this AI risk assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tb28apB_vS29BwgX4dI4ejM_QmQ4dW9Q/edit?gid=1599051758#gid=1599051758) yesterday (thanks to a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harry-harrold-359336_ai-risk-assessment-wildlife-trustxlsx-activity-7330593379493281792-t29Z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAg7nF4BPCf-EWreA1kj4La1XKtSFGZkJIs) from Harry Harrold). This is a really interesting approach and demonstrates intentional thinking (and learning) before implementing AI systems even in seemingly non-impactful ways. I get so frustrated at people talking as though there is no risk in transcription usage for example and so just implement it in workplaces with no consultation or understanding of what the impact could be.
