_As part of our work on the [Community Campaigns on Data: Campaigners Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jgmduqp1336) we have identified a series of case studies that provide an insight into how data is a key component of campaigns._

The [#BoycottSchoolCensus campaign](https://defenddigitalme.org/my-school-records/boycottschoolcensus/) stopped schools from collecting data on children’s country of birth nationality and sharing this with the Home Office where it was to be used for “carrying out immigration checks through schools”.

When outline information about plans for this data collection and use became public in 2015, campaigners used Freedom of Information requests, and worked with MPs to ask parliamentary questions, to reveal details.

A coalition, launched by teaching staff, parents and civil society groups urged parents and schools to boycott the new data collection and used social media to raise wide awareness of this call. By 2017, 25% of schools and families did not return required nationality data. Teachers Unions passed motions opposing the collection of nationality and country of birth data.

An appeal was made to the Information Commissioner's Office, and campaigners launched a crowdfunder to be able to threaten legal action. In 2018, the government ended the collection of nationality and country of birth data, and data that had been collected was later deleted. However, information sharing with the Home Office was not stopped.
