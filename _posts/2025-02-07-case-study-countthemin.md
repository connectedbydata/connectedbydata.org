_As part of our work on the [Community Campaigns on Data: Campaigners Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jgmduqp1336) we have identified a series of case studies that provide an insight into how data is a key component of campaigns._

The "Count Them In" campaign, led by the Royal British Legion and Poppyscotland, successfully lobbied for the inclusion of a question about military service in the 2021 Census in England, Wales, and Scotland. This community-driven change ensures that, for the first time, data on the Armed Forces community will be collected, with the aim of identifying and addressing their needs. The campaign commenced in 2016 and culminated in legislation change in 2020.

The campaign saw friends and family of armed forces members write to their local MPs, and share the stories of individuals who had served.

Over time, it garnered widespread support from MPs, councils, and the public, highlighting the importance of recognising the contributions and requirements of veterans and their families.

**Campaign type:** Defining data 

**Ultimate goals:** inclusion in census for a community to better document their needs.

**Communities involved:** past and present members of the armed forces.

**Organisation:** Royal British Legion and Poppyscotland.

**Methods used:** lobbying, parliamentary engagement, case studies.
