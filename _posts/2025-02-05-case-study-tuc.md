_As part of our work on the [Community Campaigns on Data: Campaigners Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jgmduqp1336) we have identified a series of case studies that provide an insight into how data is a key component of campaigns._

The Trade Unions Congress (TUC) have developed a programme of work focussed on supporting workers to have a voice whenever new data and AI systems are introduced into the workplace. Through [training resources](https://www.tuc.org.uk/artificial-intelligence-ai/ai-guides-union-officers-and-reps) for workplace trade union representatives, they highlight existing rights (such as the right to be consulted under data protection laws), and suggest routes for developing collective bargaining and worker representation in technology decisions.

In 2021 the TUC published a manifesto on [Dignity at Work at the AI Revolution](https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/The_AI_Revolution_20121_Manifesto_AW.pdf) calling for a new statutory duty to consult, and in 2024 ahead of the UK General Election they put forward a draft [Artificial Intelligence (Employment and Regulation) Bill](https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/ai-bill-project), drafted in consultation with a wide range of groups, to highlight changes a new government should explore. 

**Campaign type:** Data governance

**Ultimate goals:** Workers to be consulted when new technologies are introduced.

**Communities involved:** trade union members, national trade unionists.

**Organisation:** Trade Unions Congress and other unions.

**Methods used:** Training and capacity building, collective bargaining, manifesto / proposing solutions, lobbying.
