On 9th June the [Prime Minister announced a skills drive on AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-launches-national-skills-drive-to-unlock-opportunities-for-young-people-in-tech) focussed technical/functional skills for students and workers, with the announcement centred on industry collaborations, and economic impacts of AI. 

Drawing on inputs from a meeting of the Charity AI Taskforce, and from the Data & AI Civil Society Network, and with feedback from contributors listed below, we drafted an open letter to call for a greater focus of investment and action on scaling and sustaining comprehensive critical AI literacy programmes for all citizens.

The letter was open for signature over June, and has been sent to the Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Science, and Secretary of State for Education.
