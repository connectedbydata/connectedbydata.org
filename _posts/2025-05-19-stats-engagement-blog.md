One of the subjects we’ve been looking at as part of our project on [giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) is statistics. In February, we ran a Design Lab with the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) on the role of public participation in statistics, as they refresh the Code of Practice for Statistics.

<!--more-->
We were going to write up a case study of where the public has been involved in official statistics, as with some of the other subjects we’ve explored, [like](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-legal-aid-agency) [procurement](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-procurement-camden) and the [National Data Library](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-12-05-design-lab-ndl). Indeed, the NDL case study - on the [Confidentiality Advisory Group](https://connectedbydata.org/resources/case-study-cag) - may provide a useful model (for example, stats producers wanting their numbers to be marked as ‘official statistics’ could be required to engage the public, in the same way CAG expects engagement before data is made available for research).

But instead, we thought we’d give an overview of some of the examples we’ve found. What have we missed? What should we add? Were you involved in, or do you have any further information about, any of the examples below? Get in touch! 

## **UK Statistics Assembly**
This was recommended by [the Lievesley Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-uk-statistics-authority-uksa-2023) into the UK Statistics Authority in March 2024. (The UKSA is the non-ministerial department which oversees [the UK’s statistical system](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/) - the Office for National Statistics, or ONS, is its executive arm, and the Office for Statistics Regulation its regulatory one.)

The Review said that the Assembly should be triennial and ‘involve key organisations inside and outside Government and across the four nations, with the remit of determining the UK’s needs for statistics through a wide consultative process’. The UKSA should then publish a statement of priorities for the next three years. [The UKSA agreed](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/authority-response-to-the-independent-review-of-the-uk-statistics-authority/), and the Assembly took place in January 2025.

I was lucky enough to go along. [The Assembly](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/uk-statistics-assembly-2025/) was an impressive feat, bringing together hundreds of people in person and online for discussions on subjects including user engagement, AI and statistics, net zero, and the future of the Census. It was a conference, rather than a deliberative assembly, but gave people from the public sector, private sector, third sector and elsewhere the chance to share their views on statistics in the UK. The UKSA has published [a report on the Assembly](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/independent-report-on-the-2025-uk-statistics-assembly/) - one of the [common issues](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/independent-report-on-the-2025-uk-statistics-assembly/pages/4/) that came up across the day was the need to ‘Improve user and public engagement and communication’.

## **User forums**
Some speakers at the [Assembly’s](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/independent-report-on-the-2025-uk-statistics-assembly/) [user engagement session](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/independent-report-on-the-2025-uk-statistics-assembly/pages/5/#lg_5-4-user-engagement) talked about a previous initiative for engaging stats users, the Statistics User Forum (which had evolved from the Statistics User Council), driven by [the late Ian Maclean MBE](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/article/182/1/373/7070121). The Council brought together users and producers of statistics from the 1970s, primarily at annual conferences for a range of statistics, before the [SUF was founded](https://www.frsug.org/reports/Briefing_Note_on_SUF_October_2015.pdf) in 2004 (hosted by the Royal Statistical Society, with funding from the ESRC and support from the UK Statistics Authority). 

Some of those fora have evolved into initiatives overseen by the ONS. An overarching one is the [StatsUserNetwork](https://www.statsusernetwork.ons.gov.uk/), a new ‘online discussion forum for users and producers of official statistics to discuss statistical interests’ which replaces [StatsUserNet](https://www.statsusernet.org.uk/login). 

The ONS highlights [other forums](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/engagingwithourusers/onsforums) on its website, designed for ‘strategic engagement with partner organisations across a range of topics’. These include a quarterly ONS Assembly with representatives from the charity and civil society sectors, chaired by the ONS Director of Communications and Digital Publishing, ‘to provide insight, support and critical feedback on ONS plans and approaches’. There are also several[ National Statistician Advisory Committees and Panels](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-authority-board/committees/national-statisticians-advisory-committees-and-panels/) on subjects including data ethics, labour market statistics and crime statistics.

There are also forums around the [Government Statistical Service’s (GSS) 12 core engagement themes](https://www.beta.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/engagingwithourusers/themebasedengagement). The [GSS User Engagement Strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/#diverse-portfolio-of-statistical-products-and-statistics-producers-within-the-uk) says engagement should be organised by theme, and allow users and producers to collaborate to develop work programmes, identify data gaps, discuss presentation and improve products. An expert senior civil servant leads each theme and is expected to chair user forums, convene producers and users, and build a diverse user community and calendar of activity. The 12 themes are:
* Prices and inflation (led by ONS)
* National accounts (ONS)
* Public sector finances (ONS)
* Global trade and investment (ONS)
* Labour market (ONS)
* Security, crime and justice (ONS)
* Welfare, well-being and housing (DWP)
* Children and education (DfE, Ofsted)
* Transport (DfT)
* Environment, climate and nature (ONS)
* Health and social care (ONS,[ United Kingdom Health Statistics Steering Group](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/user-facing-pages/health-and-care-statistics/))
* Population, migration and census (ONS).

The [GSS user engagement strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/) and [accompanying case studies](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/) also mention [using topical forums to build stronger relationships with audiences](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#office-for-national-statistics-using-topical-forums-to-build-stronger-relationships-with-audiences). They cite specifically forums started in 2017 and covering a range of topics on Population and Public Policy, which feature ONS presentations, external speakers (from e.g. thinktanks), panel discussions and breakout spaces. Attendees appear to be policy officials and researchers from external organisations (such as thinktanks), there has also been a panel of young people talking about their experiences of social media, education and the labour market. The GSS also cites the [DBT user forum](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#department-for-business-and-trade-setting-up-a-successful-user-forum), which has been running since the 1990s and provides a space for information and discussion about construction and housing statistics. The OSR also cites ONS stakeholder forums[ as a case study](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/data-sharing-and-linkage-for-the-public-good-follow-up-report/pages/4/#pid-case-study-ons-stakeholder-forums).

In Scotland, [a 2024 public dialogue](https://www.gov.scot/publications/public-dialogue-use-data-public-sector-scotland/pages/1/) (with Sciencewise) explored the use of data by the public sector through a pilot public engagement panel (building on [other panel-based initiavties](https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2021/03/22/introducing-the-digital-ethics-peoples-panel/)). In Wales, the Welsh Government’s [Third Sector Statistics User Panel](https://www.gov.wales/third-sector-statistics-user-panel) allows the Government and civil society to develop a relationship ‘of mutual benefit’, helping the Welsh Government to understand user needs and communicate new developments, and for the third sector to provide feedback and advice.

## **Other examples**
Work by the [Office for Statistics Regulation](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/a-uk-wide-public-dialogue-exploring-what-the-public-perceive-as-public-good-use-of-data-for-research-and-statistics/) and [Administrative Data Research UK (ADR UK)](https://www.adruk.org/news-publications/news-blogs/adr-uk-and-osr-publish-research-report-on-public-perceptions-of-public-good-use-of-data-for-research-and-statistics/) to understand perceptions of ‘public good’ around the use of data and statistics for research used [several different engagement methods](https://connectedbydata.org/cases/adr-uk-and-osr-public-dialogue-on-public-good-use-of-data-for-research-and-statistics), including an expert advisory panel, community advisory group and workshops.

One example where public pressure may have influenced the approach to official statistics was around the cost of living. Cook and campaigner Jack Monroe[ urged the ONS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60140858) to change how it measured inflation and the cost of living, with low-price grocery items (and the impact on households) being missed. The ONS was aware of public interest in the issue and outlined[ how it was transforming](https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2022/01/26/measuring-the-changing-prices-and-costs-faced-by-households/) its collection of statistics on the issue, using[ alternative data sources](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/introducingalternativedatasourcesintoconsumerpricestatistics/november2021) and introducing[ experimental](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/trackingthelowestcostgroceryitemsukexperimentalanalysis/april2021toseptember2022) [analysis](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/trackingthelowestcostgroceryitemsukexperimentalanalysis/april2021toseptember2022). 

Two further examples of public engagement come from the Covid era. First, the [Covid-19 dashboard](https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19) (originally run by Public Health England, later the UK Health Security Agency) is cited in the[ GSS User Engagement Strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/), [GSS user engagement case studies](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/) and [by the OSR](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/lessons-learned-for-health-and-social-care-statistics-from-the-covid-19-pandemic-2022-update/pages/7/) and [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/policy-campaigns/policy-groups/statistics-under-pressure-steering-group/statistics-under-pressure-informing-decision-makin/statistics-under-pressure-case-studies/tracking-and-transparency-the-uk-covid-19-dashboar/). User engagement here included surveys, user research and testing, email analysis and conversations with users, which helped build trust in the product, improved the service, and gave those working on the dashboard a pool of volunteers to test things with and learn from. Second, statisticians involved in the [Coronavirus Infection Survey](https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforhouseholdsandindividuals/householdandindividualsurveys/covid19infectionsurvey) have suggested they undertook public engagement in the design and maintenance of the study, though there is little in the public domain on the details of this. The [Royal Statistical Society captures some of the challenges](https://rss.org.uk/policy-campaigns/policy-groups/statistics-under-pressure-steering-group/statistics-under-pressure-informing-decision-makin/statistics-under-pressure-case-studies/how-do-we-know-how-many-people-have-covid-19-the-c/) involved in  finding respondents during the pandemic, while in 2022,[ the ONS acknowledged](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ons-to-ed-humpherson-response-to-covid-19-infection-survey-statistics/) that it was ‘aware of the need for further public engagement’, including providing ‘users with more opportunities to understand, discuss, and challenge CIS methodology’. As with[ similar academic studies](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/public-involvement/putting-people-first-embedding-public-involvement-health-and-social-care-research/shared-commitment-first-anniversary/how-public-involvement-improved-our-study/), public involvement was necessary to collect the data.

There are some examples around identity and demographic characteristics. The [Race Disparity Audit, or Ethnicity Facts and Figures](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#race-disparity-audit-and-ethnicity-facts-and-figures-at-the-cabinet-office) (established in 2016 and again, cited by the GSS in its [strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/) and[ case studies](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/)) included an extensive user research project (with hundreds of users) and a mix of methods, including with members of the public from different ethnic groups, which shaped everything from information architecture to data presentation. More recently, the [Inclusive Data Taskforce](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-authority-board/committees/national-statisticians-advisory-committees-and-panels/national-statisticians-inclusive-data-advisory-committee/inclusive-data-taskforce/), established in 2020 ‘to improve the UK’s inclusive data holdings’ and[ publishing a report in 2021](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-authority-board/committees/national-statisticians-advisory-committees-and-panels/national-statisticians-inclusive-data-advisory-committee/inclusive-data-taskforce/inclusive-data-taskforce-report-leaving-no-one-behind-how-can-we-be-more-inclusive-in-our-data/), used a range of methods to engage the public and other stakeholders, including online consultation, a paper-based consultation, roundtables, interviews, and focus groups, including with members of the public with lived experience of a range of equality issues. 

And ahead of the 2021 Census, the ONS researched, developed and tested questions on[ sex and gender identity](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/censustransformationprogramme/questiondevelopment/sexandgenderidentityquestiondevelopmentforcensus2021). This included ongoing stakeholder engagement, including a workshop and update event. A 2024 review of the questions by the OSR, which[ recommended](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/review-of-statistics-on-gender-identity-based-on-data-collected-as-part-of-the-2021-england-and-wales-census-final-report/pages/4/) that the statistics be designated as official statistics in development rather than accredited official statistics, underlines the need for[ ongoing engagement](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/review-of-statistics-on-gender-identity-based-on-data-collected-as-part-of-the-2021-england-and-wales-census-final-report/pages/5/). The[ GSS strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/) and[ case studies](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/) also highlight[ the Scottish Government’s approach](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#scottish-government-sex-and-gender-data) on this topic – they set up a working group across the public sector that spoke to a wide range of other groups and individuals, followed by two public events with facilitated discussions.

Other examples cited in the [GSS user engagement strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/) and [case studies](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/) include:
* [Developing the Armed Forces question for 2021 Census](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#office-for-national-statistics-developing-the-armed-forces-question-for-2021-census), which included a meeting and further discussions with stakeholders about getting the design right

* [Connected Open Government Statistics (COGS)](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#connected-open-government-statistics-cogs-project-at-ons), which made use of user groups, Value Proposition Canvasses and a ‘Jobs to be Done’ approach to user needs
* [User engagement on future timescales for national and subnational population projections](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#office-for-national-statistics-user-engagement-on-future-timescales-for-national-and-subnational-population-projections), which seems to consist of sifting a mailbox, identifying contacts and publishing information for feedback
* [Gathering user needs to shape statistical bulletins](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/gss-support/user-engagement-support-and-good-practice/user-engagement-case-studies/#office-for-national-statistics-gathering-user-needs-to-shape-statistical-bulletins), which is on the classic user research end of the engagement spectrum.

The OSR also cites the [People and Nature Survey for England](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/regulatory-guidance-user-engagement/pages/4/), where Natural England ran several user workshops and a conference to support the development of the statistics. The OSR has also conducted several [systemic reviews](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/our-regulatory-work/systemic-reviews/), engaging with users of statistics in different subject areas; used focus groups, including in refreshing its [Code of Practice](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/blog/tag/sense-about-science/); and commissioned a research project on [Using statistics in everyday life](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/blog/how-do-we-use-statistics-in-everyday-life/) from the Policy Institute at King’s College London and the Behavioural Insights Team ([published in March 2025](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/how-statistics-inform-personal-decision-making)), which included semi-structured interviews with members of the public and a survey.

Some further examples that emerged from our [public participation Design Lab with the Office for Statistics Regulation](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-02-04-design-lab-stats) include:
* [Understanding Children’s Heart Surgery Outcomes](https://www.childrensheartsurgery.info/) (2016), which [‘took a good look at all the voices, questions and concerns](https://senseaboutscience.org/public-engagement-partnerships/understanding-childrens-heart-surgery-outcomes/) in public discussion about children’s heart surgery [and] created and user-tested a website to “speak” to those discussions’ to understand how best to present survival rate statistics

* Sense About Science’s guide to *[Making Sense of Forensic Genetics](https://senseaboutscience.org/activities/making-sense-of-forensic-genetics/)*, developed through a public engagement partnership with EUROFORGEN (European Forensic Genetics Network of Excellence). (The Ada Lovelace Institute’s [Citizens’ Biometrics Council](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/project/citizens-biometrics-council/) was also cited as a deliberative exercise around biometric data.)
* Public involvement meetings as part of [research on communications about clinical trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39215336/)
* Patient and public engagement work on [cardiovascular imaging](https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/areas/imaging/) from the British Heart Foundation

### **Conclusions**
The examples above illustrate the variety of methods currently used to engage people on data and statistics, from small scale surveys to bigger deliberative exercises. More of them focus on improving existing statistical products by engaging known *users*, rather than wider *public *engagement to understand broader issues (including attitudes to collecting and using those statistics in the first place).
