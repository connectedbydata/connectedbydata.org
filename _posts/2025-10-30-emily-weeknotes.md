### What I’ve been doing
I took a couple of days leave last week so with only one working day there’s been a bit of catch up this week. We’ve got a bit of a pressure point with one of our projects and it is hard to see how I can best alleviate some of the workload on others in the team. That classic balance of what simply is best done by the person that knows it best. I’m trying to keep us on top of actions from across the different projects we’re working on. It’s going to be a busy few months.

### What I need to take care of
I will be supporting the creation of a video for one of our projects - that’s going to be time pressured too so I need to be ensuring a smooth exchange of information between us, those being filmed and the videographer (as well as handling the logistics around consent etc). 

I also want to keep making progress towards our March event. I don’t want to load onto the team more work now but doing some thinking now is allowing me to plan logistics and get ahead of some bits. It needs to be flexible as we nearly always end up doing a slightly different thing than we started thinking about, but some logistics will be fixed.

Monthly reconciliation next week too including adding in a new project. 

### What I’ve been inspired or challenged or moved by
Like many I discovered Andrew Cotter and his commentary on his dogs during lockdown. This week I’ve been learning life lessons from them. If I may be so bold, [enjoy this clip](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMIrawwol60/?igsh=MWQ4bGc1em05NXMxZQ==) as an almost meditative moment.

### What I’ve been reading
I’m reading “[Thunder City](https://www.awesomebooks.com/book/9780702335471/mortal-engines-thunder-city)” by Philip Pullman for pleasure. It’s set in his traction city ‘universe’. I’m taking a while but that’s my fault, certainly not the storytelling.
