Connected by Data is proud to have contributed to the development of pioneering new standards on the use of AI to manage workers in Wales.

As part of the Trade Union Congress Cymruâ€™s reference group on AI, Adam Cantwell-Corn fed into the development of guidance that sets high standards for the voice and rights of workers concerning use of AI in public sector bodies. [The guidance](https://www.gov.wales/wales-public-sector-leading-way-responsible-ai-use) was adopted formally by the Welsh Government in December 2024.
