SOMETHING STIRS!

Hello, and welcome to our 29th Data Policy Digest, bringing you all - well, some of - the latest data and AI policy developments.

You may remember that [we put the Digest on pause](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2025/01/10/data-policy-digest) while we seek sustainable funding for it. Those efforts are ongoing (and please let us know if you have [any feedback](https://forms.gle/R9gHgFePV8Ypzge17)). But given just how much has been going on, we thought it was worth putting out a slimmed-down version (no, really, it actually is) to help you catch up on what’s been happening on data and AI policy, in the UK parliament and government, at least.

<!--more-->

We also have an event coming up that we wanted to tell you about. On Thursday 20 March, we’re holding an in-person unconference in London (travel assistance available), [Engaging people on data and AI: giving people and communities a powerful say on public sector technologies](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-03-20-unconference). It’s for people (and we’re particularly keen to reach those working inside the public sector) who are interested in ensuring that public, community and worker voices are heard in decisions about data, digital and AI. And if you’ve not been to an unconference before, you get to set the agenda and have the conversations you’d like to have. 

Come along if you’re already working to engage the public through participatory processes or would like to do so in the future. Come along if you’re working directly with people and communities who are concerned about public sector uses of data, digital and AI, and want to make their voices heard. Come along if you’re engaging with members of the public on topics other than data, digital and AI and want to bring those topics into your conversations.

This is part of our wider project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake). We’ve been running an [online community of practice](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-community-of-practice) as part of that - you can [sign up for the next one on Wednesday 12 March](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-03-12-community-of-practice), where we’ll be reflecting on where public involvement in data and AI is at and where it should go next with the convenors of some other key networks.

If there’s something we’ve missed, something you’re up to that you’d like us to include next time or you have any thoughts on how useful the Digest is or could be, please get in touch via **[gavin@gavinfreeguard.com](mailto:gavin@gavinfreeguard.com)**. A reminder that Connected by Data is on Bluesky [@connectedbydata.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/connectedbydata.bsky.social), and Mastodon [@ConnectedByData@social.coop](http://social.coop/@ConnectedByData).

### **Bills, bills, bills** {#bills-bills-bills}
*Or, pieces of legislation related to data and AI*

**Data (Use and Access) Bill (DUAB):** Since our last edition, the DUAB (doo-wab?) has completed its Lords stages, with [report stage](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19404) and [third reading](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19479). It’s had its first big moment in the Commons - [second reading](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19526), when MPs debate the substance of a Bill for the first time. It’s now entered [committee stage](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/stages/19679) - you can [get your evidence in to the Bill committee](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/february/data-use-and-access-bill-call-for-evidence/) (but hurry - the committee meets for the first time on 4 March and will be accepting evidence until 18 March at the latest - ‘You are strongly advised to submit your written evidence as soon as possible’).

If you’d like to get (back) up to speed… the Open Rights Group had [a briefing for second reading](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/publications/briefing-the-data-use-and-access-bill-second-reading/), and [held an online event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIXGz9KGzM)… there are briefings from [Big Brother Watch](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Big-Brother-Watchs-Briefing-on-the-Data-Use-and-Access-Bill-for-Second-Reading-HoC-2025.pdf), [Public Law Project](https://publiclawproject.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/02/250207_-Data-Bill-Second-Reading-HoC.pdf), [Defend Digital Me](https://defenddigitalme.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DUA-Bill-Committee-Stage-2025-Briefing-v1.4.pdf), the [National Data Guardian](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-data-guardian-briefing-on-the-data-use-and-access-bill), [NI Human Rights Commission](https://nihrc.org/publication/detail/nihrc-briefing-on-the-data-use-and-access-bill-hl), and the [Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10186/)… and there’s [a working group on the Bill](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/#data-bill) as part of the [Data and AI Civil Society Network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/).

Also worth noting that the government has announced it will use the Bill to [ban sexually explicit deepfakes](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/better-protection-for-victims-thanks-to-new-law-on-sexually-explicit-deepfakes)… and there’s [a call for evidence](https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/use-of-evidence-generated-by-software-in-criminal-proceedings) on computer evidence - you may remember the current presumption that evidence from software is [assumed to be correct](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/use-of-computer-evidence-in-court-to-be-interrogated), which [the Post Office Horizon scandal has challenged](https://rozenberg.substack.com/p/computer-says-nothing), to put it mildly.

**AI Bill:** We’re still awaiting what was expected to be a frontier-focused Bill (we think that the government [needs to set out other steps](https://demos.co.uk/research/the-frontier-ai-bill-and-briefing-paper/) alongside it). The government still intends to bring forward legislation, [as per an answer in the Lords](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2025-02-10/debates/21486D38-2175-49E5-A23F-EF2D076F8F11/ArtificialIntelligenceRegulation), but it’s taking longer than expected - Politico reported that may [owe something to events across the Atlantic](https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-led-the-world-ai-safety-now-waiting-donald-trump/) and was now earmarked for ‘spring’, while [the Guardian goes for ‘summer](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/24/uk-delays-plans-to-regulate-ai-as-ministers-seek-to-align-with-trump-administration)’ (we may yet get an [entire set of Vivaldi violin concerti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA) before it’s actually published).

You may remember Tory peer, Lord Holmes, previously brought a private members’ bill on AI - he’s just published [a report building on it](https://lordchrisholmes.com/ai-regulation-report/).

**Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill:** [Coming in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill). There’s a [consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ransomware-proposals-to-increase-incident-reporting-and-reduce-payments-to-criminals) on [ransomware](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-14/hcws365), and [an NAO report](https://www.nao.org.uk/press-releases/cyber-threat-to-uk-government-is-severe-and-advancing-quickly-spending-watchdog-finds/), to keep you busy in the meantime. Or [Robert De Niro getting to grips with cyber attacks](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81598435), if you’d prefer.

**Online Safety Act:** As ever, check out the [Online Safety Act Network](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/) and [their newsletter](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=8569c2a50489c6ef87ca271f2&id=6f3bd44856) for more.

**Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act: **[‘Government ousts UK competition watchdog chair’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2d3e6zklxgo), was the BBC headline in January. The development prompted questions in [Commons](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-01-22/debates/93E9A4BD-B679-44A2-AFE3-4327B373F899/CompetitionAndMarketsAuthorityChairman) and [Lords](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2025-01-27/debates/FCA104A0-144B-4B04-A652-B63378738733/CompetitionAndMarketsAuthorityChairman) (and [a ministerial statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-22/hcws380)), and [fears from a pretty diverse coalition](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/06/tech-firms-publishers-which-magazine-raise-fears-new-boss-competition-regulator-doug-gurr) about new chair, and former Amazon UK boss, Doug Gurr.

**Public Authorities (Fraud, Error and Recovery) Bill:** Cast your mind back to the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill. Remember the controversial ‘DWP clauses’ giving the department powers to access data on people’s bank accounts? And the Labour government’s decision not to include that in the DUAB but to bring something forward separately?

The [Public Authorities (Fraud, Error and Recovery) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3921) has been [introduced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/biggest-fraud-crackdown-in-a-generation) into the [Commons](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-22/hcws383) and is at committee stage (the bill committee is [taking evidence](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/february/public-authorities-fraud-error-and-recovery-bill-call-for-evidence/), until 20 March AT THE LATEST). The [Commons Library has a briefing](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10183/)… the ICO has [updated its response](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/what-we-do/ico-policy-views/eligibility-verification-measure-in-the-public-authorities-bill-information-commissioners-response)… Big Brother Watch have [launched a campaign](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/campaigns/stop-bank-spying/)… Policy in Practice have [taken a look](https://policyinpractice.co.uk/the-fraud-error-and-recovery-bill-a-fresh-approach-to-fraud-or-fuel-for-stigma/)… and [Disability News Service](https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/bill-would-force-banks-to-carry-out-mass-surveillance-of-millions-of-innocent-disabled-people-mps-are-told/) and the [Big Issue](https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/dwp-benefit-fraud-crackdown-backlash-privacy/) have some summaries, including of [second reading debate](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3921/stages/19472).

Oh, and while we’re on financial checks… [Home Office contractor collected data on UK citizens while checking migrants’ finances](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/23/home-office-contractor-collecting-data-on-uk-citizens-while-checking-migrants-finances), reports The Observer.

**Other Bills: **The [Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3909) is awaiting a date for report stage (Defend Digital Me have [an update](https://defenddigitalme.org/2025/02/07/impact-assessment-and-scrutiny-not-fit-for-purpose-the-childrens-wellbeing-and-schools-bill-so-far/) on what’s happened so far)… so is [the Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3766)… and the [Product Regulation and Metrology Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3752) starts report on 26 February.

**Private Member’s Bills:** Remember - these are unlikely to pass without government support, but…

In the Commons, Friday 7 March brings the second reading of several relevant bills, including [Protection of Children (Digital Safety and Data Protection) Bill](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49138) (Josh MacAlister, Lab), [Children Not in School (Registers, Support and Orders) Bill](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal49284) (Paul Holmes, Con) and [Public Body Ethnicity Data (Inclusion of Jewish and Sikh Categories) Bill](https://whatson.parliament.uk/event/cal50767) (Preet Kaur Gill, Lab)...

In the Lords, both Lord Clement-Jones’ (Lib Dem) [Public Authority Algorithmic and Automated Decision-Making Systems Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3760) and Baroness Owen’s [Non-Consensual Sexually Explicit Images and Videos (Offences) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3759/stages) had their third readings on 20 January.

### **Digital centre of the universe** {#digital-centre-of-the-universe}
*Or, what the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology and other parts of government have been doing on data and AI*

Another quiet one 🙃

I promised this would be short, so…

**AI** The government published the long-awaited [AI Opportunities Action Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan) (and [its response](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response)) on 13 January. [AI teacher tools](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-teacher-tools-set-to-break-down-barriers-to-opportunity) were the focus of one DSIT press release, [small businesses another](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-puts-ai-to-work-for-bakers-road-workers-and-more), [inward investment yet another](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-ai-sector-attracts-200-million-a-day-in-private-investment-since-july), while [Peter Kyle’s written statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-13/hcws360) gave a broader summary and said he’d [‘front up’ any problems](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/tech-secretary-says-take-flack-ai-expansion-goes-wrong) with public sector AI roll out, which is certainly an approach to accountability. Report author Matt Clifford has been named the [PM’s AI Opportunities adviser](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-matt-clifford-cbe-as-the-ai-opportunities-adviser) (and had an [updated register of interests published](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/matt-cliffords-declared-outside-interests)). The PM himself wrote for the FT - [Britain doesn’t need to walk a US or EU path on AI: Going our own way will unleash national renewal](https://www.ft.com/content/4d448059-5a3f-405c-9343-84cf7e5b90c0). [Minderoo](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/ai-opportunities-action-plan-falls-short-of-challenges-of-tech-and-the-uk-economy/), [the ODI](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/can-the-ai-opportunities-action-plan-deliver/), [the LGA](https://www.local.gov.uk/parliament/briefings-and-responses/ai-opportunities-action-plan-lga-response), [techUK](https://www.techuk.org/resource/the-uk-s-ai-moment-an-ambitious-new-plan-for-innovation-and-growth.html) and [Dan McQuillan](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Labours-AI-Action-Plan-a-gift-to-the-far-right) were among those publishing responses, along with [political sketch writer Rob Hutton](https://thecritic.co.uk/robot-dreams/).

You can also [express interest](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-fires-starting-gun-on-ai-growth-zones-to-turbocharge-plan-for-change) in becoming an [AI Growth Zone](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-growth-zones-expression-of-interest)… there was another release of [algorithmic transparency records](https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records), including [several from local government](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-sensors-on-fridges-and-kettles-helping-vulnerable-people-to-live-independently)… GDS published an [AI Playbook for the UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government)… the government [responded to a previous select committee report](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6986/governance-of-artificial-intelligence-ai/publications/) on the governance of AI… the [AI Cyber Security Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-cyber-security-code-of-practice) was updated following a [consultation](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-02-03/hcws409) ([more](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-on-cyber-governance) [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-ai-cyber-security-standard-to-protect-digital-economy-and-deliver-plan-for-change), plus a [whole collection of docs](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ai-cyber-security))… there’s a [new collection of AI guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/artificial-intelligence-resources-for-the-public-sector) on GOV.UK… [World-leading AI trial to tackle breast cancer launched](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-ai-trial-to-tackle-breast-cancer-launched)… [UK-backed AI companies to transform British cancer care and spark new drug breakthroughs](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-backed-ai-companies-to-transform-british-cancer-care-and-spark-new-drug-breakthroughs)… [Fellowships launched to explore how AI could change the way scientists drive new discoveries](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fellowships-launched-to-explore-how-ai-could-change-the-way-scientists-drive-new-discoveries)… [AI and satellites speed up planning approvals by tracking wild habitats across England](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-and-satellites-speed-up-planning-approvals-by-tracking-wild-habitats-across-england)… i.AI’s Engagement and Strategy Manager wrote for the Heywood Quarterly on [why the policy profession must embrace AI](https://heywoodquarterly.com/why-the-policy-profession-must-embrace-ai/)… 

And then, of course, we had [the AI Action Summit](https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia) in Paris (10-11 February), with [London fringe](https://aifringe.org/). Ahead of the event, the [first International AI Safety Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-international-ai-safety-report-to-inform-discussions-at-ai-action-summit) was published and some additional organisations signed up to the [commitments from the AI Safety Summit in Seoul](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024#full-publication-update-history) (and New Zealand have been added to [the original Bletchley declaration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration#full-publication-update-history)). But the big UK government story was the UK, along with the US ([VP Vance’s speech](https://lk.usembassy.gov/remarks-by-vice-president-vance-at-the-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-summit/) was another major talking point), not signing the Summit declaration (coverage from [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8edn0n58gwo), [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/11/us-uk-paris-ai-summit-artificial-intelligence-declaration), [Sky](https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-uk-didnt-sign-up-to-global-ai-agreement-13307926)). Chi Onwurah, chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology select committee, [made a statement](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-innovation-and-technology-committee/news/205243/chair-comment-ai-action-summit/) and [asked the government about it](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-02-12/debates/860F1CF9-036F-4589-A302-A6EFDF21DD1A/OralAnswersToQuestions#contribution-E57CC0D5-DB2F-479D-957B-06EB5E6C3A26). (And while we’re on the Summit, we were delighted to be part of the [Participatory AI Research & Practice Symposium](https://pairs25.notion.site/) - Tech Policy Press have [a few essays on the event](https://www.techpolicy.press/category/participatory-ai-research-practice-symposium/).)

And last but not least… on 14 February, the AI Safety Institute became the AI Security Institute - [‘Tackling AI security risks to unleash growth and deliver Plan for Change’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tackling-ai-security-risks-to-unleash-growth-and-deliver-plan-for-change) surely wins government buzzword shoehorn bingo - and the [government signed an agreement with AI giant, Anthropic](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-uk-and-anthropic-on-ai-opportunities). That same day (not entirely coincidentally, one imagines), Peter Kyle addressed the [Munich Security Conference](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/remarks-made-by-technology-secretary-peter-kyle-at-the-munich-security-conference) (somewhat overshadowed by [another Vance speech](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/18/vance-speech-munich-full-text-read-transcript-europe/)).

**Digital centre** Forget AI - the machinery that the *really* cool kids care about is machinery of government. On 21 January, the government [announced](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-21/hcws375) that [the Government Digital Service would expand](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/shake-up-of-tech-and-ai-usage-across-nhs-and-other-public-services-to-deliver-plan-for-change) to [include](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/01/27/same-name-new-ambitions) the Central Digital and Data Office, Incubator for AI and the Geospatial Commission (and bits of the [Responsible Technology Adoption Unit](https://rtau.blog.gov.uk/2025/01/22/continuing-to-drive-responsible-adoption-of-technology/)), alongside a review of the current [state of digital government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-digital-government-review) (previewed with [‘Archaic tech sees public sector miss £45 billion annual savings’](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/archaic-tech-sees-public-sector-miss-45-billion-annual-savings)), [a wider blueprint for the future](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government) and other announcements including [new apps](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-driving-licence-coming-this-year) for the public and [a new suite of AI tools for public servants](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/dsit-humphrey-ai-package-civil-servants-45bn-productivity-drive). And on the subject of rejigging the digital centre - the [government chief data officer is departing](https://www.publictechnology.net/2025/02/14/education-and-skills/excl-government-likely-to-recruit-new-data-chief-as-incumbent-suckling-departs/) after less than a year in post, while [DSIT has disbanded the One Login Inclusion and Privacy Advisory Group](https://www.publictechnology.net/2025/02/21/society-and-welfare/excl-gds-closes-one-login-privacy-and-inclusion-scrutiny-group/) as the digital centre thinks about its approach to external engagement.

The State of Digital Government Review touched on the data and digital initiatives in the government’s major projects portfolio, the [latest report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infrastructure-and-projects-authority-annual-report-2023-24) on which has just been published (DSIT data [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dsit-government-major-projects-portfolio-data-2024), as details emerge on government’s [new major projects body](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-01-17/hcws368)). Additionally, [Algorithmic transparency requirement added to digital spend controls](https://www.publictechnology.net/2025/02/19/public-order-justice-and-rights/algorithmic-transparency-requirement-added-to-digital-spend-controls/), reports Public Technology.

And DSIT also got in on the [National Procurement Policy Statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-small-businesses-to-benefit-from-new-government-buying-rules-boosting-local-jobs-growth-and-innovation) fun (the zenith of stuff that sounds dull but is actually very important for how government works).

**Copyrights and wrongs** The [government consultation on AI and copyright](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-consults-on-proposals-to-give-creative-industries-and-ai-developers-clarity-over-copyright-laws) closed earlier this week. The Guardian reports that [‘UK ministers consider changing AI plans to protect creative industries’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/uk-ministers-planning-to-change-ai-plans-to-protect-creative-industries), with notable campaigns from the [creative](https://www.creativerightsinai.co.uk/) and [media](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/news-titles-from-guardian-to-daily-mail-unite-in-opposition-to-ai-copyright-grab/) industries grabbing attention. The chairs of the Science, Innovation and Technology, and Culture, Media and Sport select committees have [written to ministers](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-innovation-and-technology-committee/news/205480/two-crossparty-committees-respond-to-government-consultation-on-artificial-intelligence-and-copyright/), saying that ‘The principle that everyone should receive fair remuneration for their creative work should underpin the relationship between the AI sector and rights holders’.

Minderoo, the Bennett Institute and ai@cam at the University of Cambridge published [a big report on the topic](https://www.mctd.ac.uk/policy-brief-ai-copyright-productivity-uk-creative-industries/). 

And worth keeping an eye on [the EU situation](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/19/eu-accused-of-leaving-devastating-copyright-loophole-in-ai-act) and [this court case](https://www.reuters.com/legal/thomson-reuters-wins-ai-copyright-fair-use-ruling-against-one-time-competitor-2025-02-11/), too.

**Other DSIT news:** The big one: after eleven years, the UK government has [a new digital inclusion strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps) (see also: [press release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-increase-digital-skills-to-deliver-growth-and-opportunity-for-all)). You can [respond to the consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/digital-inclusion-action-plan) (closes 9 April) or even [express interest in joining](https://apply-for-public-appointment.service.gov.uk/roles/8585) the Digital Inclusion Action Committee (which we [mentioned last time](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2025/01/10/data-policy-digest#dsit-up-and-take-notice)).

It was commissioned by the previous government [back in December 2023](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/illegal-pornography-abuse-and-exploitation-to-be-investigated-by-new-reviewer), so it’s been a long time… being prepared.

**Other bits of government:** Let’s start with foreign policy, shall we? A week ago - it feels like a lot longer - The [Sunday Times reported](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/can-keir-starmer-make-a-deal-with-trump-its-a-balancing-act-2dmp8nt76) that Downing Street was keen to [get closer to the US on AI](https://bsky.app/profile/jdportes.bsky.social/post/3lithfezjsc2j).

## **In brief** {#in-brief}
*Or, a quick overview of some other key developments*

**States of play:** Well. It’s all going very well, isn’t it? Threw was an early [executive order on ‘removing barriers’ to US leadership on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/), and then… Birkbeck’s Ben Worthy has blogged about how [Donald Trump is plunging government websites into darkness, with profound consequences for American democracy](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2025/02/11/donald-trump-is-plunging-government-websites-into-darkness-with-profound-consequences-for-american-democracy/), while Tech Policy Press [have](https://www.techpolicy.press/doge-understands-something-the-us-policy-establishment-does-not-technology-is-the-spinal-cord-of-government/) [several](https://www.techpolicy.press/anatomy-of-an-ai-coup/) [pieces](https://www.techpolicy.press/data-colonialism-comes-home-to-the-us-resistance-must-too/) on DOGE’s activities, as [does](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-incompetence-mistakes-feature-not-bug/) [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/surveillance-privacy-doge-federal-employees/) and [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/tag/doge/), while [538 also look at data deletion](https://abcnews.go.com/538/matters-trump-deleting-government-data/story?id=119003153) and Politico’s [West Wing Playbook looks at DOGE and data](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook-remaking-government/2025/02/20/our-chat-with-elons-ai-about-doge-data-00205300). The NYT has some [detailed reporting on the Musk takeover of the federal bureaucracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/musk-federal-bureaucracy-takeover.html?unlocked_article_code=1.0U4.v30G.88-Qo7R0VGjY&smid=url-share) - the Atlantic [made an earlier attempt](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/doge-musk-federal-agencies-takeover/681744/).

And there’s also [a statement from staff](https://18f.org/) at the recently shuttered digital agency, 18F.

**Here’s looking at EU:** The new [Commission Work Programme](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/strategy-documents/commission-work-programme_en) (for the next year) has [a fair few data and digital bits and pieces](https://www.techuk.org/resource/eu-commission-publishes-its-work-programme-for-2025.html), although [not an expected AI Liability Directive](https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/commission-plans-to-withdraw-ai-liability-directive-draw-mixed-reactions/)… and in Germany, Politico have taken a look at [How Germany’s far right is harnessing AI to win votes](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-far-right-harness-artificial-intelligence-win-election/) ([they won a fair few](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/germany/)).

**Thinktanks and civil society:** At Connected by Data, we added some case studies to our [community campaigners toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit#heading=h.jgmduqp1336); contributed to the development of [pioneering new standards](https://connectedbydata.org/news/2025/01/15/wales-wpc-guidance) on the use of AI to manage workers in Wales; Jeni and I contributed to TPX Impact’s [State of Data report](https://pages.tpximpact.com/the-state-of-data-report); and we worked with the Ada Lovelace Institute and Demos on what civil society and others would [like to see alongside a frontier AI Bill](https://demos.co.uk/research/the-frontier-ai-bill-and-briefing-paper/)… 

Speaking of whom… Demos have been very busy with reports on [epistemic security and information supply chains](https://demos.co.uk/research/epistemic-security-2029-fortifying-the-uks-information-supply-chain-to-tackle-the-democratic-emergency/), [election law in the age of AI](https://demos.co.uk/research/free-and-fair-election-law-in-the-age-of-ai/), and [advancing digital rights](https://demos.co.uk/research/advancing-digital-rights-in-2025-trends-challenges-and-opportunities-in-the-uk-eu-and-global-landscape/), and coordinating an open letter on the need for [a citizen-led declaration of digital rights and principles](https://demos.co.uk/research/open-letter-calling-for-uk-government-to-adopt-a-citizen-led-uk-declaration-of-digital-rights-principles/)… and Ada with [previewing the AI Action Summit](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/a-piece-of-the-action/), a report on [AI and education](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/a-learning-curve) (they’ve [blogged on that](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/learning-and-teaching-with-ai/), and [AI companions](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/ai-companions/) and [access to data frameworks](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/access-to-data-frameworks/)), and another on [public compute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/computing-commons/)…

I think I managed to miss the ODI’s new [AI Data Transparency Index](https://theodi.org/insights/reports/the-ai-data-transparency-index/) - they’ve also published new [reports](https://theodi.org/insights/) on topics including [Privacy Enhancing Technologies](https://theodi.org/insights/reports/trust-and-transparency-in-privacy-enhancing-technologies/), and [various blogposts](https://theodi.org/news-and-events/blog/), while I was one of the contributors to a [policy webina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4rNXwyfcf0)r looking ahead at data and AI policy in the UK, Europe and US in 2025…

The Institute for the Future of Work published their [major Pissarides Review](https://pissaridesreview.ifow.org/) into the Future of Work and Wellbeing (launching it with [a conference](https://www.ifow.org/event/making-the-future-work---the-closing-conference-of-the-pissarides-review)), and reports on [how tech adoption is reshaping work](https://www.ifow.org/publications/taking-work-or-changing-work-understanding-how-technology-adoption-is-reshaping-work-in-the-uk) and looking at [the distribution of capabilities amidst technological change](https://www.ifow.org/publications/analysing-the-distribution-of-capabilities-in-the-uk-workforce-amidst-technological-change)…
