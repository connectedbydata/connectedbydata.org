_As part of our work on the [Community Campaigns on Data: Campaigners Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnBDI-BIgG4B3WEYKSog2-yJEXpw7OIglBHXDap-q1g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jgmduqp1336) we have identified a series of case studies that provide an insight into how data is a key component of campaigns._

In 2009 the civic technology community faced high costs in accessing postcode data which was essential to build online tools connecting people to local services or political action. A key dataset - mapping postcodes to locations - was collected and owned by public bodies, but only available for a fee. Campaigners tried to create a grassroots alternative dataset, free of intellectual property restrictions - but this was a laborious process.

In order to secure access to the official data, a loose coalition of campaigners wrote media articles, talked to politicians, and organised an effective civil disobedience stunt. They created [a free website](http://www.freethepostcode.org/) hosting an unofficial copy of the postcode dataset (technically breaching the law), and named the site after the Minister who originally launched postcodes (Ernest Marples). They wired up high-profile civic websites to rely on this unofficial service, so when the official custodian of the postcode data [took legal action to shut it down](https://blog.okfn.org/2009/10/05/ernest-marples-uk-postcode-site-has-been-taken-down/), these [useful civic services went offline too](https://www.markpack.org.uk/5125/postcode-campaign-gears-up-to-save-popular-web-services/). This gave campaigners fuel for a higher-profile media campaign about the problems of closed data. A petition on the government website gained 2,335 signatories. 

In May 2010, postcode data was made available as open data (although address data remains closed). 

**Campaign type:** Data access (open data)

**Ultimate goals:** Provide affordable public good technology services; unlock social and economic potential of data.

**Communities involved:** Civic technology community; users of public services.

**Organisation:** Informal coalition.

**Methods used:** Media, petitions, stunts, civil disobedience.
