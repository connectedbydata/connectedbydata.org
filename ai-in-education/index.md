### Who is this for? 

The Workshop in a Box has been designed to be used in schools, colleges and informal settings (e.g. home education or youth groups). There are versions for Key Stage 2/3 and Key Stage 4/5.

You don’t need to be an AI expert to lead a session using this resource: simply to have an interest in exploring AI in Education with your class or group. 

### Is this England only?

Although designed with the education system in England in mind, the toolkit is also available to use and adapt in other regions and countries. We encourage educators from countries and regions participating in the UK AI in Education Summit to also use the toolkit and share their views.

### How long will I need to run a session?

The resources are flexible, and can be used over 45 to 120 minutes across one or two sessions.

We’ve included suggested timed lesson plans for a 50 minute and 100 minute session. 

### What happens to the ideas and views we gather during a session?

If you run your session and share feedback before 15th December 2025, it will form part of a report that will be presented to global education ministers, AI experts, and tech companies at the UK AI in Education Summit. 

The Department for Education wants the views of pupils to be meaningfully represented at the summit and is asking, "what do children and young people want from companies designing generative AI for education?". The views and creative outputs that pupils share will be collated and shared back to summit attendees to frame the conversation at the UK AI in Education Summit. We will also share a copy of the report back with you. 

You can also use the Workshop in a Box to talk about decisions you want to make about Generative AI in Education in your classroom, school or local area. In this case, you will be able to share views of pupils into your own local decision making.

### When can we deliver the workshop?

The Workshop can be delivered within the timetable, or as a separate session for a voluntary or invited group of students. 

The full session plans include optional activities involving elements of english (persuasive writing), art (creative visuals) and design technology or computer science (mock-up application design).
