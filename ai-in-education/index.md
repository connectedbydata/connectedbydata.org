### Who is this for? 

The Workshop in a Box has been designed to be used in schools, colleges and informal settings (e.g. home education or youth groups). There are versions for Key Stage 2/3 and Key Stage 4/5.

You don’t need to be an AI expert to lead a session using this resource: simply to have an interest in exploring AI in education with your class or group. 

### Is this England only?

Although designed with the education system in England in mind, the toolkit is also available to use and adapt in other regions and countries. We encourage educators from countries and regions participating in the Department for Education (DfE) AI in Education Summit to also use the toolkit and share their views.

### How long will I need to run a session?

The resources are flexible, and can be used over 45 to 120 minutes across one or two sessions.

We’ve included suggested timed lesson plans for a 50 minute and 100 minute session. 

### What happens to the ideas and views we gather during a session?

Sessions using the Workshop in a Box before 15th December 2025 could provide feedback that formed part of a report that will presented to global education ministers, AI experts, and tech companies at the DfE AI in Education Summit in January 2026. 

You can now use the Workshop in a Box to talk about decisions you want to make about Generative AI in Education in your classroom, school or local area. It is up to you how you share views of pupils into your own local decision making.

### When can we deliver the workshop?

The Workshop can be delivered within the timetable, or as a separate session for a voluntary or invited group of students. 

The full session plans include optional activities involving elements of english (persuasive writing), art (creative visuals) and design technology or computer science (mock-up application design).

### Where can I find out more about government policy and policy-making on Generative AI in Education? 

Education is a devolved issue across the United Kingdom. You can find current [policy on generative AI in Education for England on Gov.UK here](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/using-technology-in-education#artificial-intelligence).

The Department for Education has published online materials to support staff in schools and colleges in England to use AI safely and effectively, you can find [these resources on Gov.UK here](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/using-ai-in-education-settings-support-materials).

The Department for Education has also published a generative AI product safety expectations framework, which outline the capabilities and features that generative AI products and systems should meet to be considered safe for users in education. [These expectations can be found on Gov.uk here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-ai-product-safety-expectations/generative-ai-product-safety-expectations).
