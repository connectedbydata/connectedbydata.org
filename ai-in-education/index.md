### Who is this for? 

The Workshop in a Box has been designed to be used in schools, colleges and informal settings (e.g. home education or youth groups). There are versions for Key Stage 2/3 and Key Stage 4/5.

You don’t need to be an AI expert to lead a session using this resource: simply to have an interest in exploring AI in Education with your class or group. 

### Is this England only?

Although designed with the education system in England in mind, the toolkit is also available to use and adapt in other regions and countries. We encourage educators from countries and regions participating in the UK AI in Education Summit to also use the toolkit and share their views.

### How long will I need to run a session?

The resources are flexible, and can be used over 45 to 120 minutes across one or two sessions.

We’ve included suggested timed lesson plans for a 50 minute and 100 minute session. 

### What happens to the ideas and views we gather during a session?

If you run your session and can send in feedback before 9th January 2026, it will form part of a report that will be presented at the UK AI in Education Summit on 22nd January, attended by Education Ministers and leaders from over 20 countries, and by leading AI firms. 

We will also share a copy of the report back with you.

You can also use the Workshop in a Box to talk about decisions you want to make about Generative AI in Education in your classroom, school or local area. In this case, you will be able to feed views explored into your own local decision making.

### When can we deliver the workshop?

The Workshop can be delivered within the timetable, or as a separate session for a voluntary or invited group of students. 

The full session plans include optional activities involving elements of english (persuasive writing), art (creative visuals) and design technology or computer science (mock-up application design).
