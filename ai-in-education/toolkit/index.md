title: Access the Workshop in a Box
---

What is generative artificial intelligence? And how might it be used in schools and colleges? What do the people building it need to hear from children, parents and educators? 

This resource is designed to help you have informed and deliberative conversations about generative AI in education, the ways it can be used, and the issues that might raise. 

It is designed to be used in the classroom - providing a single or double lesson plan for discussing generative AI in education with 10 to 18 year olds (variations provided).

### Earlier versions

The Workshop in a Box was updated in January 2026 to reflect the close of the feedback portal for inputs to the Generative AI in Education Summit. [A zip file version of the workshop with live feedback activities is available here](/ai-in-education/files/2025-gen-ai-education-workshop-in-a-box-v3.zip).

We made small updates to the slides and guide on 2nd December to reflect early feedback. The previous version of the resources can be [found here (pdf, zip)](/ai-in-education/files/2025-gen-ai-education-workshop-in-a-box.zip).
