title: Privacy Policy - AI in Education
---

This data protection policy describes how and why we use data, content and information about or by students and educators as part of the Generative AI in Education: Have Your Say project. This use falls under the following categories:

* [registration for participation](#registration-for-participation)  
* [submitted student work](#submitted-student-work)

The data controller for this data is the Department for Education. We are a data processor, operating under their instruction. This data protection policy provides details about our data collection and use under each of these categories, [your rights](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BabLsCqFMwFPXHgl7NIdYJywUYrYD_hmZcA0m1mU2EM/edit#heading=h.5ogtqee7d31x) around data about and by you, and how to provide [feedback and complaints](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BabLsCqFMwFPXHgl7NIdYJywUYrYD_hmZcA0m1mU2EM/edit#heading=h.wse5cbn6vzy2) about our data processing.

We hold only the minimum amount of data or content about you. We will not use data or content for big data analytics or training AI systems, and the data we hold will not be shared or processed to create profiles or target you for marketing.

### Registration for participation {#registration-for-participation}

We collect data from educators who register for participation in this project.

This data includes contact information about the educator, their school and the classes they are intending to run a workshop with.

These are held in [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/).

We process this data under the [consent lawful basis](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/consent/). We use it to contact you with information about the project and to get your feedback about the toolkit. We also use it to understand which schools, colleges and classes are taking part in the project, so that we can monitor the reach of the project and the demographic makeup of the areas schools are in.

We will delete your contact details after a period of six months following the completion of the project. We keep it for this time in case there is any follow-up work, such as an evaluation of the project, that would require getting in touch with you again.

Educators may object to this processing and data retention at any time by emailing [dpo@connectedbydata.org](mailto:dpo@connectedbydata.org), in which case we will bring forward that deletion process.

### Submitted student work {#submitted-student-work}

We collect content that students have created as part of this project. Some of this creative feedback that’s submitted may also be selected to display in a gallery at the AI in Education Summit and to reproduce it in reports or presentations.

This content includes scanned creative work such as drawings, letters, and statements, and collective class feedback on statements about generative AI in education. We ask educators to block out information in student work that should not be shared with us, such as personal or sensitive information. If we select work for display, we will let you know and will double check ourselves that it does not contain anything personal or sensitive.

This content is held in [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) and in a [Pol.is](http://Pol.is) instance operated by the Department for Education. Selected content may also be included in documents, slideshows and reports about the project.

This content will be used for non-commercial research. It will be analysed to identify messages for a report on student feedback to the AI in Education Summit.

If we get a large amount of submitted student work, we may make use of AI tools within Airtable to help us:

* Transcribe handwritten / drawn feedback into searchable text  
* Automatically apply themes to each item of feedback

AirTable uses models from [Amazon, Google, OpenAI and IBM](https://www.airtable.com/company/third-party-provider-ai-terms-policies) to process content. [Airtable’s terms of service for AI state](https://www.airtable.com/company/ai-terms) “Airtable does not use, or permit others to use, Input or Output to train the generative artificial intelligence models used to provide Airtable AI.” We will not use submitted student work to train AI models.

We process this data under the [legitimate interests lawful basis](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/):

* **Purpose:** we use this data to create a report about what students think about generative AI in education  
* **Necessity:** we cannot understand what students think without having and processing their feedback and content  
* **Balancing test:** we believe informing the adoption of AI in education through student voices is in the public interest, and that the controls we have put in place mean that risks to the interests of individual students is minimal

Copyright law lets us reproduce this content in documents and reports because it has been [submitted to a public body](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-copyright-law) (the Department for Education) as part of its public business.

We have a small oversight group of children's rights experts who will guide our use of this data and content during analysis.

We will delete most of this content within six months of the end of the project. However, the creative feedback we select to share in documents and reports will be kept within those documents and reports indefinitely.

As a student or parent, you may object to this processing and data retention at any time by emailing [dpo@connectedbydata.org](mailto:dpo@connectedbydata.org), in which case we will bring forward that deletion process. However, if the content was already included in documents and reports arising from this project, we will not be able to remove it from those.
