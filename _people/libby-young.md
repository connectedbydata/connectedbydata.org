As a PhD candidate in critical technology studies, co-supervised through Sydney Law School and Monash’s School of Media Studies, her current research considers personal data governance in democratic cultures, focused on the interrelated questions ‘what is personal data, and how should we use it?’.

Libby is working with us to research data stories and narratives.
