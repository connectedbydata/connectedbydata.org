Graham Tavener is currently Course Leader for A-level Physics at a large sixth form college near Nottingham, UK. He cites Max Tegmark, Professor of Physics and founder of the Future of Life Institute, as an inspirational figure for his work in promoting the view that scientists and technologists should not just concern themselves with developing AI technology but should also deeply consider the ethics and societal implications of their work.

Graham is researching into effective ways to survey and collate the views of the 2000+ students at this college on how AI should be introduced and implemented, with the primary aim of giving meaningful voice to students’ views in future decision making by the College’s leadership team. The methodology and results will then be shared with others in education sector with the additional aim that this may offer a framework for others to follow suit, overall increasing the likelihood that students’ views be included widely throughout the sector in accordance with the principle that adoption decisions of this technology should be made at the lowest possible level, in consultation with those affected.

In addition to teaching Graham is also involved in the development of policy for the Green Party and most recently co-authored the party’s policy on AI regulation which was adopted into their Policies for a Sustainable Society in Sept 2024.

Graham also plays bass guitar for a couple of bands, asserting that by doing so he is keeping alive the all-too-human trait of doing things to a mediocre standard just for the hell of it, which we may come to value more in the wave of AI-enhanced perfection that is surely coming!
