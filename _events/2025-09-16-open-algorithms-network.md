Along with Lucia Errandonea from [Participation AI](https://participationai.org/) Tim presented the draft principles on public participation in AI procurement to the Open Government Partnership's Open Algorithms Network, which brings together government representatives from over 10 countries within the OGP Network.

The session offered an opportunity to get feedback on the draft principles, and to explore some of the challenges governments face in embedding transparency and participation within technology procurement activities.
