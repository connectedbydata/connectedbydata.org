**The future of the Community of Practice**
Connected by Data has been running the Data and AI Public Engagement Community of Practice since July 2024, to allow people to share their work and learn from others on engaging the public around data and AI, work through common challenges, and bring together practitioners from different sectors.

The 15 events to date – monthly online meetings for around one hour, 2pm on a Wednesday – have largely consisted of two presentations, but we have also run an online workshop and a panel discussion. 

The Community of Practice is part of a wider project and funding for that project ends in March 2026, while Connected by Data – always intended to be a five-year campaign – is due to come to an end in March 2027.

That means we are considering what happens next to the community of practice – in terms of maintaining the archive of presentations to date, and how and where (and whether) to continue it. We ask you to take a little time to complete a survey on your thoughts. The survey is available in [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUSlUtfBWxU2a6ugUqLpdDIGtGjI-v3ITRjc4bCNet-qy2dw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=114205531888267655117) or [MS Forms](https://forms.office.com/r/gPvfrr2eAW) format. Your answers to this survey will help inform the next steps.
