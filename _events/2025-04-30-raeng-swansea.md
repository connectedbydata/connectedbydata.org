Tim attended the Swansea edition of the [Royal Academy of Engineering's People's AI Stewardship Summit](https://raeng.org.uk/people-s-ai-stewardship-summits) as an invited stakeholder. 

The Summits, which are taking place in the Royal Academy of Engineering's regional enterprise hubs across the United Kingdom, are day long public engagement events involving a diverse cross-section of the public, in dialogue with local innovators and policy makers, on various issues related to AI.
