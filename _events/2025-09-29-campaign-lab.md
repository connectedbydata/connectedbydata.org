This session is part of The Campaign Fringe, an all-day gathering of progressive campaigners and experts exploring bold ideas, practical tools, and best practice. Held on September 29th at the Camp and Furnace Liverpool, The Campaign Fringe is where effective campaigners share what works.

​In the debut session, Campaign Lab is bringing together experts to unpack the risks and possibilities of AI as it relates to democratic campaigning.

Artificial intelligence is transforming political campaigning, but the implications remain poorly understood. With political literature in an instant, counter-messaging at the drop of a hat and unprecedented research capacity comes misinformation that is more compelling and cheaper than ever before, alongside wholly new kinds of political risk. This panel examines both the opportunities and risks of AI in campaigning contexts, exploring how progressive campaigns can harness these tools responsibly while defending against malicious uses. Join Campaign Lab for an expert panel discussion with critical analysis for campaign professionals navigating this uncharted technological territory.

Chair: Elizabeth Seger, Associate Director of Digital Policy & AI, Demos

Speakers:
* ​Hannah O'Rourke, Director, Campaign Lab
* ​Dan Howl, Head of Policy and Public Affairs, BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT
* ​Kanishka Narayan, Labour MP Vale of Glamorgan
