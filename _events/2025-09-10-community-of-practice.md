On Wednesday 10 September 2025 at 2pm we held the eleventh meeting of a [community of practice]((https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-community-of-practice)) as part of our project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) projects.

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The theme of this session is responsible AI. Our speaker was:
* [Tracey Brown OBE](https://senseaboutscience.org/team/tracey-brown/), Director of Sense About Science, on their [Responsible Handover Framework](https://senseaboutscience.org/responsible-handover-of-ai/)

> The write up of this session is now available to community of practice members only.
