At the Open Government Partnership Summit in October 2025 Participation AI and Connected by Data will launch a set of principles for public engagement in AI procurement. 

In this brown-bag lunch at the OpenGovHub in Washington DC we'll be sharing the draft principles for discussion, and gathering shared insights and inputs on how they can be put into practice.

**How can different publics and civil society play a greater role in the procurement of AI-driven systems in the public sector? How can AI procurement decisions include the voices of the most affected communities?**

At the Open Government Partnership Summit in October 2025 [Participation AI](https://participationai.org/) and [Connected by Data](https://connectedbydata.org/) will launch a set of principles for public engagement in AI procurement that provide:

* A clear vision for how public participation and stakeholder engagement should shape public sector AI
* Practical steps and guidance for public authorities and their partners to take to embed participatory procurement practices
* Guidance, signposting and standards to support implementation

The first draft of these principles draws upon the research for ‘[Stakeholder Engagement in Public Procurement for Artificial Intelligence: a Mission-Oriented Playbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IRJv08KAVJZcQip7Ves1iY2vJFNr5b_5/view?usp=drive_link)’ and on [an open online collaborative drafting process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZincDflsCdbfN-4BJQo6AunvjUHextHqHmRitoKf20Q/edit).

Over September, we are testing the principles with governments, procurement experts and participation practitioners. 

Join us for this brown-bag lunch and discussion to:

* Learn about the draft principles;
* Share your vision for public engagement in procurement of AI;
* Share experiences and promising practice related to AI, procurement and participation;
* Provide input to help finalise the principles and supporting guidance;
* Explore opportunities to put the principles into practice. 

You don’t need to be an expert in AI, procurement or public participation, but mild curiosity in any one of these would help!
