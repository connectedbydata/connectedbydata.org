How can schools consult with parents, pupils and teachers on school-level policies on AI in ways that help them to advance their rights, learn to think critically about technology and its capability so that they adopt it in ways that are beneficial, and exercise their democratic muscles?

<!--more-->

We know that schools and colleges are rapidly adapting to the growing use of AI in society, and exploring the potential of AI in education. From selecting or designing principles, policies and guidance, to making decisions about which EdTech tools to adopt for schoolwork or homework, to thinking about where AI might be addressed and utilised in the classroom or school office, there are big questions to grapple with. At Connected by Data, we believe that effective data and technology governance should involve those affected: teachers, students, parents and leaders. However, the ask for schools to carry out informed stakeholder engagement on a fast-moving topic like AI can be a tall order. 

In this one-day workshop we’re bringing together educators, academics, participation practitioners and policy makers to explore practical ideas for a resource, or resources, that could help schools to consult with their communities on AI and EdTech decision making. Based on the workshop outcomes, we’ll work up one or more of the ideas refined on the day into a toolkit to be published in the autumn.
