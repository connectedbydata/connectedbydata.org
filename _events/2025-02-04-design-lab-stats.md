The [Office for Statistics Regulation](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) (OSR) is currently running a [consultation](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/consultation-on-proposed-changes-to-the-code-of-practice-for-statistics/) on a refresh of the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Code-of-Practice-for-Statistics-REVISED.pdf) (the Code) to ensure it continues to meet the needs of its wide and evolving audience. The Code sets the standards that producers of official statistics should commit to. Compliance with the Code gives people confidence that published government statistics have public value, are high quality, and are produced by people and organisations that are trustworthy.

The revised Code includes even greater emphasis on engaging with the public to better:
* understand and satisfy their **needs** as users of statistics
* understand and promote the **social acceptability** of statistics

Alongside the Code, the OSR wants to provide guidance that helps statistics producers to carry out this engagement, and document their public engagement strategies and approaches. This Design Lab, with Connected by Data, aims to explore and provide the basis for this guidance.
