Join us to explore the methods and findings from the <a href="/ai-in-education/">Generative AI in Education: Have your Say</a> distributed dialogue and to ask how we can make sure that future decisions about data and AI in education are shaped by the voices of the students affected.

<!--more-->

This hour long session is designed for education and education leaders to share practical insights into:

* What students think of generative AI in education: drawing on a distributed dialogue with over 1,000 students;
* How schools and colleges can involved students in future deliberation and decision making about AI in education;
* Wider opportunities for student voice on AI.

Taking place via Zoom. 15:00 - 16:00.
