The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit will take place in Paris on 10th and 11th February 2025. It will gather Heads of State and Government, leaders of international organisations, CEOs of small and large companies, representatives of academia, non-governmental organisations, artists and members of civil society. On this occasion, Renaissance Numérique, The Future Society, Wikimedia France, the Avaaz Foundation, Connected by Data and the European Center for Non-for-Profit Law are glad to invite you to their civil society side-event.

This side-event will gather a wide diversity of actors to discuss how to build on the momentum of the Paris AI Action Summit to strengthen the inclusion of civil society in global AI governance efforts and make it more meaningful. Building on feedback from the previous day of the Paris summit, on Renaissance Numérique’s report Global AI Governance: Empowering Civil Society, on the results of a global citizens and expert consultation organised ahead of the summit, as well as on the experience of civil society actors in the preparation of the Summit, it will identify avenues for improvement and proposals to be considered by the organisers of future summits.

It will showcase interventions by key civil society organisations, followed by a lively discussion between all participants in the audience.

**Where:** Central Paris
**When:** Tuesday 11th February 2025, from 9.00am to 12.00
