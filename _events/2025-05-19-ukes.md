She will be speaking on "Involving communities in evaluating public sector AI".

AI companies are making great claims about how their tools can improve public sector productivity and effectiveness, and the Government is pushing for rapid and large-scale adoption of AI to realise those benefits. At the same time many people are worried about how AI-driven public services might affect their work and lives. In this context, we need evaluation that both moves at the speed of innovation and provides assurance for those affected by AI tools. In her keynote, Jeni will explore how and why to involve people, communities and civil society in monitoring and evaluating AI in the public sector and beyond.
