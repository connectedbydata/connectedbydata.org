This conference is for anyone interested in how to achieve better outcomes in the delivery of digital, data and AI work in the public sector through the involvement of the public, communities and workers. Come if you’re a public servant trying to engage or involve the public in your work on technology. Come if you’re working in civil society, in the union movement, or with grassroots groups, trying to be heard. Come to share what you’re up to, and to learn from others; leave with new insights, ideas, and connections.

The use of data and AI within the public sector is essential for the efficient delivery of digital public services and for effective, evidence-based policymaking. But the citizens, communities and public sector workers affected by these technologies are often wary. They are (rightly) concerned about the safety and security of their data; about inaccuracies and biases in automated decision making; about impacts on the quality of their work; and about being forced to use apps and chatbots when they just want to speak to a real person.

Involving and empowering the public and public sector workers – through deliberative and participatory methods – can help avoid harmful impacts, increase trust and enhance adoption. Engaging with civil society and grassroots groups can ensure that vital monitoring, checks and balances are in place and any problems are addressed quickly. These steps can also provide those developing, evaluating and shaping data and AI technologies with insight and support.

This conference forms part of Connected by Data’s project supported by the Mohn Westlake Foundation, [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI projects](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake), and builds on our convening to date, including our [2025 unconference](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-03-20-unconference), our design labs on [Supporting Collective School Decision Making on AI and Education Technology](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-07-22-design-lab-dfe) (with DfE) and [Involving people in the design of digital public services](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-07-07-design-lab-gds) (with GDS), and[ our community of practice](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-community-of-practice).
