The [Blueprint for Modern Digital Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government-html) commits to providing “clear and actionable guidance to embed best practices in trust and responsibility” and cites Camden Council’s [data charter](https://www.camden.gov.uk/data-charter), co-created with citizens, as an example of how public bodies can maintain public trust and confidence. It says that civil society groups will be “invited to co-design services in partnership with communities and public sector workers to ensure they are responsive to their needs.”

The [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) (GDS) maintains a [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) that contains guidance to help teams to deliver great digital public services, against the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). It includes a good section on [user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research). However, co-design is not just about users, and requires a deeper integration of the public, civil society, and public sector workers, across all design phases.

This Design Lab, with Connected by Data, aims to explore and provide the basis for new guidance to be included within the Service Manual to support co-design.
