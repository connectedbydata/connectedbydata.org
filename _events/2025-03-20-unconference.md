Unconferences are participant-driven meetups that focus on sharing, learning and community building.

This unconference is for people (particularly inside the public sector) who are interested in ensuring that public, community and worker voices are heard in decisions about data, digital and AI.

<!--more-->

Come along if you're already working to engage the public through participatory processes or would like to do so in the future. Come along if you're working directly with people and communities who are concerned about public sector uses of data, digital and AI, and want to make their voices heard. Come along if you're engaging with member of the public on topics other than data, digital and AI and want to bring those topics into your conversations.

We have about 80 places. If you would like to attend please complete the form below. We welcome you sharing this form with anyone (and everyone!) you think may also be interested.

## Logistics
**When:** Thursday 20 March 2025, 10:00-15:30, UK time

**Where:** [Churchill Hall](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/leisure-libraries-and-community/community-halls/churchill-hall), Churchill Gardens Road, London, SW1V 3AG. 

**Format:** This is an unconference, which means the agenda is decided by you. On the day, we’ll ask people to pitch the sessions they’d like to run and the conversations you’d like to have (you can also suggest ideas using the form below).

The day is broken down into sessions with breakout rooms available for each (several concurrent conversations). If you're unsure how this format works you can [watch this short video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mgilroy_ok-this-sounds-like-a-cool-concept-but-activity-7258090198394138624-5269/) and/or [read this blog](https://blog.weareconvivio.com/what-to-expect-at-ukgovcamp-ecc37191dc81) which although specifically about another unconference many of the principles will apply to our day, and/or email [Emily](mailto:emily@connectedbydata.org).

We have about 80 places. The first batch (around 60) will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. After those have been filled we will email you to let you know you are on a wait list and doing a 'random allocation' for the final spaces.
