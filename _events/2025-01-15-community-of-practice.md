On Wednesday 15 January 2025 at 2pm we will hold the fourth meeting of a community of practice as part of our project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) projects.

<!--more-->

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The network meets on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an existing [data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

In our[ first](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-07-18-community-of-practice) and[ second](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-10-03-community-of-practice) events, we had presentations from practitioners engaging the public. Our [third event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-12-11-community-of-practice) was an online workshop around the question, what do public engagement practitioners need to succeed?

This event will focus on how to engage different communities, including historically excluded ones. Speakers will include:
* **Henrietta Hopkins**, Director, [Hopkins Van Mil](https://www.hopkinsvanmil.co.uk/)
* **Emily Rempel**, Public Participation Manager, [Liverpool City Region Civic Data Cooperative](https://civicdatacooperative.com/)

There will be future meetings (all online, Wednesdays at 2pm) on:
* 12 February, on the different engagement and involvement techniques people can use
* 12 March, reflecting on a year of our project with other public engagement networks.
