On Wednesday 12 March 2025 at 2pm we will hold the sixth meeting of a community of practice as part of our project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) projects.

<!--more-->

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The network meets on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an existing [data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

In our [first](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-07-18-community-of-practice) and [second](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-10-03-community-of-practice) events, we had presentations from practitioners engaging the public. Our [third event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-12-11-community-of-practice) was an online workshop around the question, what do public engagement practitioners need to succeed? Our [fourth event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-01-15-community-of-practice) had presentations on how to engage different communities, including historically excluded ones, and our [fifth](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-02-12-community-of-practice) presentations on different methods for involving the public. 

Our sixth event will reflect on what we’ve learned over the first year of this project, and ask **what’s next for public involvement on data and AI** with the help of some other key networks.

Speakers will include:
* **Dea Begaj**, Social Researcher, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology
* **Annie Radcliffe**, Adviser: Cyber, Digital, and Technology, Local Government Association
* **Shayda Kashef**, Senior Public Engagement Manager, ADR UK (Administrative Data Research UK).
