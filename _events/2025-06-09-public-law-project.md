Is the law keeping pace with technology to protect people’s rights and uphold transparency and accountability standards? How can public, regulatory and human rights law help ensure technologies are deployed for the benefit of society? The Public Law and Technology Conference seeks to consider these questions.

Jeni will be speaking as part of the 'AI and ADM in welfare benefits' panel.

Does the DWPs deployment of technology bring with it the risk of unlawful or discriminatory decision making? How would we know, and what can be done to protect those at risk? What new rights could support us? The panel will look at how to obtain information in ‘black box’ situations, and what standards of transparency reporting are needed to ensure accountability. The panel will also look at how the law can, should and could be applied where ADM is used to make decisions affecting those reliant on good decision making at the DWP.
