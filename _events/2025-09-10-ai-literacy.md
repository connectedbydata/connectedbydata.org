Building on our open letter on AI Literacy, we are participating in an online panel on the topic 'Why Critical AI Literacy Matters:
implications for policy and practice in UK and Canada'

<!--more-->

As AI tools increasingly permeate everyday life, it presupposes that people will have the knowledge and skills to use them. But research has shown that it is essential for people to critically understand, question, and ethically use AI technologies. This suggests that the AI literacy needs to expand to include informed decision-making, critical engagement, and resistance to technological coercion as well as considerations of digital equity.

The panel will convene digital advocacy organizations, public bodies and researchers for a public talk and research panel that explores the emerging role of critical AI literacy and the implications for digital divides.
