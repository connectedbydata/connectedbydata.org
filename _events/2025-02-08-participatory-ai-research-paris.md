The Paris Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, in its focus on the public interest, trust, and governance,¬† acknowledges that trust in AI depends on an effective feedback loop among AI developers, regulators and the broad public: necessitating more participatory approaches to AI development and governance. Scholars and policymakers have emphasised the importance of integrating diverse voices, particularly from marginalised and underrepresented communities, into AI decision-making processes to mitigate the bias, inequality, and ethical blind spots. A shift towards a participatory model challenges traditional, top-down and expert-driven approaches to AI governance and raises important questions about power, agency, representation, and accountability. Amid this incipient ‚Äúparticipatory turn‚Äù in both the development and governance of AI our goal is to showcase work that demonstrates what it looks like, how and why to do it, as well as what can go wrong.
