Connected by Data have spent the past 6 months working with [5 community campaigns on data](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-catalysing-communities), exploring different kinds of data power, and different strategies and tactics to address it. These campaigns span areas such as housing, health, online safety, and care. They are embedded in their communities, working for the change that their lived experience tells them is needed to make data and related technologies work for society. 

<!--more-->

By working together with these campaigns, we have been looking at social change advocacy through the lens of ‘data campaigns’: asking what, if anything, is different about social change campaigns that make data an ultimate, or intermediate, object of focus.

In this event, our campaigns will share their experience of working with communities on social justice issues, identifying how data intersects with this, and developing an effective campaigning plan to make change happen at the right intervention points.

Connected by Data will share our experience of supporting a cohort of campaigners, and developing resources to enable further community campaigning on data.

The event will be an opportunity for knowledge sharing among:
* Campaigners working on diverse social justice issues seeking to identify and address data issues relevant to their communities 
* Those working in participatory data governance seeking to understand grassroots, community level contributions to the field
* Decisionmakers wishing to understand and support community voices around data
