Local and national governments are spending $millions on Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to support efficiency and reform in service delivery, and new AI features are being offered in many of the existing tools governments use. 

Join us on the **morning of Monday 6th October** for a fringe event of the OGP Global Summit to explore the role of procurement in shaping AI in government, and the role of public participation in shaping AI procurement.

## More detail

In this fringe event of the [OGP Global Summit](https://spain.ogpsummit.org/) we will present a new set of principles for Public Participation in AI Procurement drawing on the Participation AI “[Stakeholder Engagement in Public Procurement for Artificial Intelligence Mission-Oriented Playbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IRJv08KAVJZcQip7Ves1iY2vJFNr5b_5/view)” - as well as practical methods for involving diverse groups at different stages of the procurement lifecycle.

## Who is it for?

* **OGP Contact Points** - Looking to develop effective national or local OGP commitments on AI;
* **Public procurement practitioners** - Looking to understand opportunities and challenges around engaging public stakeholders across the procurement cycle;
* **Open contacting / procurement transparency advocates and campaigners** - Looking to explore approaches to participatory procurement;
* **Civil society organisations** - Looking to identify new models for transparency, accountability and participation in the governance of public sector artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems.

You don’t need to be an expert in AI, procurement or public participation to take part, but mild curiosity in any one of these would help! 

This interactive session will include lightning talks, networking, group discussion & hands-on learning.
