Local and national governments are spending $millions on Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to support efficiency and reform in service delivery, and new AI features are being offered in many of the existing tools governments use. In this session we will be exploring the role of procurement in shaping AI in government: and asking how procurement decisions can be shaped by public input from those affected.

Join us for this fringe event of the [OGP Global Summit](https://spain.ogpsummit.org/) to explore a new set of principles for Public Participation in AI Procurement drawing on the Participation AI “[Stakeholder Engagement in Public Procurement for Artificial Intelligence Mission-Oriented Playbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IRJv08KAVJZcQip7Ves1iY2vJFNr5b_5/view)” - as well as practical methods for involving diverse groups at different stages of the procurement lifecycle.

You don’t need to be an expert in AI, procurement or public participation to take part, but mild curiosity in any one of these would help! 

This interactive session will include lightning talks, networking, group discussion & hands-on learning.

Co-organised with: [Participation AI](https://participationai.org/), [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/), [Posterity Global](https://www.posterity.global/) as a fringe event of the [Open Government Partnership Global Summit](https://spain.ogpsummit.org/).
