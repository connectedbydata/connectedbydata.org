Local government is at the front-line in piloting and deploying new AI and data-driven tools in the search for savings and service improvement. How can and should local governments engage with local residents when planning, evaluating and governing data and AI-enabled reforms? And what are the challenges and opportunities of involving the public in decision-making on data and AI uses?

Join [The Data Justice Lab](https://datajusticelab.org/) at the University of Cardiff, Connected by Data and the [Liverpool City Region Civic Data Co-operative](https://civicdatacooperative.com/) for an interactive day of learning and exchange on the what, why and how of a participatory local approach to data and AI. 

**Who is the day for?**
This day is for leaders and practitioners from across local public sector bodies interested in how to engage with residents when planning or implementing new data and AI initiatives. You might be:

* A senior officer thinking about organisation wide AI strategy, or managing pilots of new data-driven tools and services;
* A service manager in the earliest stages of thinking about AI adoption, or already working on a technology pilot or roll-out;
* A technology specialist supporting colleagues to explore data and AI innovation, or setting organisational policies;
* A procurement professional managing organisational engagement with data and AI suppliers;
* An engagement officer exploring new ways of involving local residents in policy debate;
* A councillor or board member providing scrutiny or strategic direction on engagement with data and AI.

In short, if you work in local government and want to learn from peers, get expert advice on opportunities and methods for public engagement around data and AI, and workshop live challenges you are facing around taking a resident-centred approach, this is a day for you. 

Topics may include: Methods for citizen engagement; getting buy-in for participatory AI projects; participatory procurement and oversight; principles and charters for citizen-oriented data/AI governance; AI literacy for citizens and staff; etc. The programme will respond to your needs and interests.
