At ParticipationAI, they believe this needs to change.

Join them for a one-hour session to explore how AI procurement can become more participatory, inclusive, and democratically accountable.

🔍 They’ll share insights from new research by Ismael Peña-López, based on first-hand experiences with the Spanish public administration and how AI is being procured today.

📝 An overview of the landscape of public participation and AI procurements by Tim Davies, Research Director at Connected by Data.

💡 Open a space to collect ideas, reflections and strategies as part of a co-creation process for a Manifesto on public participation and AI procurements.

This is more than a webinar — it’s the beginning of a community of practice for public servants, technologists, civil society, and researchers working toward more just and democratic AI.

Proudly hosted by the ParticipationAI team: Thai Jungpanich, Thais Ruiz de Alda, judith M., Anna Colom, PhD and Lucia Errandonea.
