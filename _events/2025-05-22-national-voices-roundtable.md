AI innovation has the potential to drive dramatic change in healthcare: but too often innovation is driven by industry and supply-side developments, rather than responding to the needs articulated by patients. Innovation driven by industry capabilities and economic concerns alone risks exacerbating health inequalities already prevalent within the NHS.

The government’s drive for a ‘Scan > Pilot > Scale’ model ([AI Opportunities Action Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan/ai-opportunities-action-plan)) could make this problem more acute  unless there are stronger demand-side signals from patients and practitioners to help guide investment and innovation and clearer vision from Government on the problems AI should be directed to solve.

Many patient groups are still grappling with understanding the potential of AI. This makes it difficult for them to describe what they need or would like, or to adequately scrutinise proposals for AI adoption to foreground patient priorities and ensure equitable scaling. 

[National Voices](https://www.nationalvoices.org.uk/) and Connected by Data will organise a 90 minute roundtable for up to 20 participants under the heading aligning AI innovation in healthcare with patient need and the future NHS.

This will be structured around a set of invited provocations, and responses, with a view of laying groundwork for pitching future funded projects.
