[Do With](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/projects/do-with) is not a new organisation or formal campaign. Instead, it hopes to be a grassroots movement for change led by the people who are part of it. As such, this event on 26 March will be a space for attendees to share ideas on how they would like to deliver change and to connect people together who want to work on specific ideas. Those ideas could operate within public sector teams and organisations or within communities or both; and could operate at local, regional or national level.

Jeni Tennison will be attending, and running a session on data and AI [at this event](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/events/dowith-making-movement-happen). "If you’ve been inspired by the Do With vision and want to work with others to shift the public sector away from its current ‘do to’ mindset and practices towards a ‘do with’ approach, please join us between 10.00 am and 12.00 pm on Wednesday 26 March for an online meeting. The event is free and open to anyone working in or with the public sector who wants to move towards a more humane, democratic and impactful way of working."
