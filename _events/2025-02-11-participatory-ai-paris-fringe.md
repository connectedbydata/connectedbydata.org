The [AI Fringe in Paris](https://aifringe.org/) is an officially accredited side event of the [AI Action Summit](https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia). With support from 25 corporate and civil society partners, the Fringe aims to bring together the views of industry, civil society, academia and policymakers on discussions around safe and beneficial AI, as well as broadening the conversation on AI to include less represented voices. 

Building on discussions at the [Participatory AI Research and Practice Symposium](https://pairs25.notion.site), Connected by Data and partners are hosting an in-person hour of lightning talks and panel discussion on practical approaches to public engagement in AI, focussing on the steps that industry, academia and government could take to embed a ‘participatory turn’ in shaping the future of AI.
