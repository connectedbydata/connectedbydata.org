In contrast to the halting approach to reform from the current UK government, Donald Trump and Elon Musk have moved fast to slash staff and programmes. That has led some of those frustrated with the slow pace of government reform in the UK and elsewhere to see DOGE as a model for radical reformers. 

<!--more-->

But what are the actual benefits – and costs – of the Trump administration approach? Is there anything to be learnt from DOGE, or is the whole approach misconceived? And what is the better, feasible model for reformers who want to deliver change at rapid pace while avoiding the DOGE template?  

To explore these questions and more, the IfG is pleased to bring together an expert panel featuring:
* Munira Mirza, former Director of the No.10 Policy Unit
* Don Moynihan, Professor of Public Policy, Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan
* Jeni Tennison, the founder and Executive Director of Connected by Data
* Alex Thomas, Civil Service Programme Director at the Institute for Government
* The event will be chaired by Jill Rutter, Senior Fellow at the Institute for Government.
