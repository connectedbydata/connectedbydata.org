On Wednesday 18 June 2025 at 2pm we will hold the ninth meeting of a [community of practice]((https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-community-of-practice)) as part of our project on [Giving communities a powerful say in public sector data and AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake) projects.

<!--more-->

It’s designed to bring together people across the public sector working on (or interested in) engaging the public on data and AI, with those in civil society, the private sector and academia working in the field. It’ll be a safe space to hear about what others are doing and work through common challenges.

The network meets on a Chatham House basis (nothing attributed unless you want it to be, anything confidential excluded altogether), with notes circulated within the network. We do something similar with an existing [data and AI civil society network](https://data-and-ai-cso-network.org/), and have lots of existing links with public engagement practitioners.

In our [first](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-07-18-community-of-practice) and [second](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-10-03-community-of-practice) events, we had presentations from practitioners engaging the public. Our [third event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2024-12-11-community-of-practice) was an online workshop around the question, what do public engagement practitioners need to succeed? Our [fourth event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-01-15-community-of-practice) had presentations on how to engage different communities, including historically excluded ones, and our [fifth](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-02-12-community-of-practice) presentations on different methods for involving the public. Our [sixth event](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-03-12-community-of-practice) asked what's next for public involvement on data and AI and our [seventh](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-04-09-community-of-practice) heard about outputs from a recent Public Voices in AI programme. Our [eighth](https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-05-14-community-of-practice) meeting received inputs from Open Data Manchester and the Government Digital Service.

Speakers, on the theme of using tech tools to support public engagement, are:
* [Prateek Buch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-buch-83aa4925/), Head of Collective Intelligence at [Policy Lab](https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/)
